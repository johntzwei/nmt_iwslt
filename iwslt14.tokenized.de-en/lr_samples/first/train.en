and she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom , but also fear , because we had just come out of cam@@ bo@@ dia .
is this a market at all , or did we just do a weird psych@@ ologist &apos;s trick by getting mon@@ keys to do something , looking smart , but not really being smart .
does that really explain what we &apos;re seeing with the intellectual property bat@@ tles no@@ wa@@ days ?
z@@ k : this is something that kei@@ th and i really enjoy doing .
and i had a happy br@@ ush with conver@@ gen@@ ce until , kind of , war@@ ner basically has to li@@ qui@@ date the whole thing .

now , i used to work the wee@@ ken@@ ds at the hole in the wall off@@ -@@ seas@@ on progra@@ mming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground , and this kid who was just this really hy@@ per kid , i started calling him &quot; mon@@ key boy , &quot; and i went home and wrote a book called &quot; good night , mon@@ key boy . &quot;
thank you for coming here .
they changed the government , and it didn &apos;t work .
and of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the cro@@ ws .
there &apos;s no damage outside .
i think this approach can explain differences in people &apos;s taste in art .
we can only do several behaviors right now .

he thinks , &quot; what can i do to fix up this dog ?
and he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary .
so , where does that bring us today ?
it made him very un@@ popular . they didn &apos;t want to go back to square one .
are we in the middle of something unusual histor@@ ically in your opini@@ on ?
let &apos;s start with technology .
thank you very much .
now , i &apos;m an aging hi@@ pp@@ ie .
it became a book . it became a show .
you know , the whole x@@ o laptop , from one laptop per child , is based on the idea of collaboration and mas@@ h and net@@ working .
tom , thank you so much . it &apos;s been really , really great .
as it turns out , when tens of millions of people are un@@ emplo@@ yed or under@@ emplo@@ yed , there &apos;s a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing to the labor force .
now , i &apos;ll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick , but it &apos;s a trick that actually works .
and he says , &quot; i could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free . &quot;
in that the sh@@ ell was origin@@ ally conc@@ ei@@ ved as a ligh@@ t@@ weight , modern , fu@@ tu@@ ri@@ stic , high-@@ tech po@@ d for hur@@ t@@ ling down the free@@ way , and the inter@@ i@@ ors were completely out of syn@@ c with that .
here &apos;s the lat@@ est virus we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called ser@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e .
so , what you see here is basically a plan of many instal@@ lations that were put there .
it &apos;s something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times .
this is fascinating . you probably know , some of you , that cells are contin@@ ually rene@@ wed . you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .
if you understand the difference between &apos; the world &apos; and &apos; my world , &apos; you understand the difference between lo@@ gos and my@@ tho@@ s .

this was a view from my home office on mau@@ i .
those kinds of studies require much larger popu@@ lations .
and i &apos;ll show you , if you take this approach , what you get , ok ?
now this was a really exciting experience for me .
and there was a dr@@ un@@ k man on there , and he got up out of his seat two or three times , and he was making everybody up@@ set by what he was trying to do .
it &apos;s called the central pattern gener@@ ator .
here in the ne@@ ther@@ lands , i think it &apos;s more than 80 percent .
so she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
it &apos;s that which is im@@ it@@ ated , or information which is cop@@ i@@ ed from person to person .
now maybe we want to treat it as metaph@@ or@@ ical .
the power generation will come from the ocean itself .
to put these numbers in perspective , microsoft has ye@@ arly re@@ ven@@ u@@ es of 60 billion dollars .

the mathematics of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics tells us this is how the world works at tiny sc@@ ales .
now , a wee@@ k@@ end in paris , a wee@@ k@@ end in ro@@ me , these are different things ; they have different food , different culture , different art .
so i thought , &quot; well let &apos;s just give it a try .

and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the ini@@ tial en@@ counter .
the auto@@ -@@ gy@@ r@@ o couldn &apos;t wait for the invention of the heli@@ cop@@ ter , but it should have -- it wasn &apos;t a big success .
and this is true of most of our living systems .
and there were a lot of c@@ ute girls in the sop@@ ran@@ o section , as it turns out .
there &apos;s still work to do .
the stories started po@@ uring out .
it &apos;s been well known that the dead sea is dying .

i don &apos;t know if you realize this , but 90 percent of the patients on the transp@@ l@@ ant list are actually waiting for a kid@@ ney .

towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought , decision making -- it &apos;s the last to ma@@ ture in late adul@@ tho@@ od .
and you see these structures , this thing we call the great wall , but there are vo@@ ids and those kinds of stuff , and they kind of fa@@ de out because the telescop@@ e isn &apos;t sensitive enough to do it .
and if design can increase positive emotion , eu@@ da@@ im@@ on@@ ia , and flow and meaning , what we &apos;re all doing together will become good enough . thank you .

if it comes up ta@@ ils , you lose nothing , you &apos;re fine , get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe , which means you have to reach back into your wal@@ let and give me five of those $ 100 bil@@ ls , for certain .

what &apos;s the long-term effect of this on us or on music ?

that &apos;s good , but again we tend to de@@ plo@@ y it sel@@ ec@@ tively .

i ad@@ mit that i &apos;m a little bit nervous here because i &apos;m going to say some radical things , about how we should think about cancer differently , to an audience that con@@ tains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than i do .
and they &apos;d look at me , like , &quot; is he serious ? &quot;
now at the end of that fl@@ y@@ by , it took the fro@@ gs fully 45 minutes to re@@ gain their ch@@ or@@ using syn@@ chron@@ ic@@ ity , during which time , and under a full moon , we watched as two co@@ y@@ ot@@ es and a great hor@@ ned ow@@ l came in to pick off a few of their numbers .

and what would be behind those ru@@ b@@ ber mas@@ ks , if they were ?
and finally , we figured , well , ok , we &apos;d better just try and take him to a public hospital .
and i look for stories on each level .
i mean , individuals own things that k@@ ings would have definitely gone to war to get .
he &apos;s got head@@ phones on , reading the newspaper , got a hat on , glas@@ ses , got a bag .
and i think that &apos;s sometimes an over@@ looked area .
all of the wind in the entire country shu@@ t down for a week .
but actually , before plac@@ ing the sc@@ aff@@ old into the patient , we actually exercise it .
there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting , and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arri@@ val of schools and jobs .
we need to focus on the where , the what and the who .
we can hu@@ g both .
it takes her one year , through re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp after re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , to make her way to an air@@ stri@@ p where we can fly out of the country .
this is from la@@ ha@@ ina , and when we &apos;re walking along a beach , we &apos;re actually walking along millions of years of biological and ge@@ ological history .
that &apos;s a piece of history , but it comes in a mathematical wra@@ pping .
save more tomorrow makes it easy .
and so it is not just what &apos;s happening to these people -- whether they &apos;re losing weight or ga@@ ining weight , or becoming rich or becoming poor , or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affec@@ ts us ; it &apos;s also the actual architecture of the ties around us .
and we &apos;re going to be talking about 600 , 700 people . &quot;
there &apos;s a fal@@ se sense of security .
s@@ ber@@ bank , the largest and ol@@ dest bank in russi@@ a , lar@@ gely ow@@ ned by the russi@@ an government , has started practic@@ ing crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing , eng@@ aging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innova@@ tions .
no effect on those things . this is what &apos;s affected .
da@@ ve eg@@ gers : my wish : once upon a school
and that &apos;s the l@@ ength of time that the earth was li@@ fel@@ ess .
but today , that super@@ star effect is happening across the entire economy .
i want you to join the pro@@ test and start dem@@ and@@ ing more sustainable sub@@ urban places -- more sustainable places , period .
and so , what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , both the cognitive system , our mind &apos;s ability to think about other minds , and the brain system that suppor@@ ts it are continu@@ ing , slowly , to develop .
when i asked my friend why the red bri@@ ga@@ des want to talk to me , he said that the female members of the organization had actually suppor@@ ted my name .
if we compare my genome to the genome of you , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely every 1,@@ 200 , 1,@@ 300 letters will diff@@ er between us .
we &apos;re at best ignor@@ ed and mal@@ ig@@ ned and ab@@ used , at worst , by ne@@ gli@@ gent regul@@ atory agen@@ cies , per@@ ni@@ cious zon@@ ing and la@@ x govern@@ mental accoun@@ t@@ ability .
on that occasi@@ on , i found my wife carrying something like this .
and this becomes the cur@@ ren@@ cy of the plasti@@ cs industry .
the only thing is that it &apos;s li@@ able to having its blu@@ ff called , and therefore can only work if it &apos;s cre@@ di@@ ble . to make it cre@@ di@@ ble , you must a@@ ven@@ ge all insu@@ l@@ ts and se@@ ttle all sc@@ or@@ es , which leads to the cy@@ cles of b@@ loo@@ dy ven@@ de@@ tt@@ a .
they wanted it mess@@ y , and we were happy to ob@@ lige .
and then , when they come out , most states don &apos;t even have a law pro@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing emplo@@ yers from dis@@ crimin@@ ating against people with a background .
and as long as we fight horizon@@ t@@ ally , against life , against the win@@ ds , against what &apos;s happening to us , life is a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are .
before that , obviously , technology didn &apos;t exist . but obviously it did .
and if you stop again , you wonder , &quot; is that a one-@@ hour valley ?
and we were in the desert -- richard wur@@ man : that &apos;s the end of this talk !
i think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn &apos;t look at how mathematics is em@@ bed@@ ded in the world we live in .
but what &apos;s the actual difference between these two ch@@ or@@ ds ?
&quot; yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
and so what i &apos;d like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the techni@@ que .
whether you believe it &apos;s true or not -- it really didn &apos;t matter to me .
in general , more than 50 percent of roads are un@@ tar@@ red .
&quot; yo na@@ po@@ t , pac@@ ak ! &quot; which , as somebody here must sur@@ ely know , means &quot; what &apos;s up , guys ? &quot; in mag@@ y@@ ar , that pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar non-@@ in@@ do@@ -@@ european language spo@@ ken by h@@ ung@@ ari@@ ans for which , given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed as bio@@ diversity on this planet , few would have imag@@ ined much of a future even a century or two ago .
now many of these companies were in america or the united king@@ dom , its over@@ se@@ as terri@@ tor@@ ies and cro@@ wn depen@@ den@@ cies , and so it &apos;s not just an off@@ sh@@ ore problem , it &apos;s an on-@@ sh@@ ore one too .
and we knew it was vol@@ can@@ ic back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , &apos; 7@@ 0s .
our team spee@@ ds up these kinds of oil sav@@ ings by what we call &quot; institu@@ tional ac@@ u@@ pun@@ c@@ ture . &quot;
the more interesting question , perhaps , is , are these forms imag@@ in@@ able ?
best example : who in the music industry , 30 years ago , would have said , &quot; yes , let &apos;s inv@@ ent a musical form which is all about dis@@ pos@@ s@@ essed black men in g@@ he@@ t@@ to@@ s expres@@ sing their fru@@ stration with the world through a form of music that many people find ini@@ tially quite difficult to listen to .
for example , most other ger@@ man@@ ic language speak@@ ers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying , &quot; morgen reg@@ net es , &quot; quite literally to an english ear , &quot; it rain tomorrow . &quot;
in a room of 40 new@@ bor@@ ns , not one of them was cr@@ ying .
even if , as a human being , you believe that , you can &apos;t say that . you &apos;re ele@@ cted for britain &apos;s interests .
in every one of these books , every one of these sets of lec@@ tures , he em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zed this puzz@@ le : why did the early universe have such a small entrop@@ y ?
o@@ .@@ k. , so let me re@@ mind you , a turing test is where you &apos;ve got a wall , you &apos;re talking to somebody on the other side of the wall , and when you don &apos;t know if that thing is human or animal -- that &apos;s when computers have reach@@ ed human intelligence .
simply doing nothing .
this is the carbon inten@@ sity of economic growth in the economy at the moment .
there &apos;s a big river called the gul@@ f stream that runs across and it &apos;s not going in the direction you are .
now when the co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e syste@@ matic re@@ vie@@ wers were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been condu@@ cted on whether tam@@ i@@ flu actually did this or not , they found that several of those trials were un@@ published .

i will take you to the cultural revolution , when china went mad , and compare that country &apos;s performance with india under indi@@ ra gand@@ hi .
he had a lot of fla@@ ws , but he was very adap@@ tive .
also it &apos;s bad news for us .
but the solution is animal tissue because it &apos;s pl@@ enti@@ ful , it &apos;s cheap , you can get it from young , healthy tis@@ su@@ es , but the bar@@ rier is imm@@ un@@ ology .
so what can we do ? how can we pre@@ p@@ are and ada@@ pt ?
the bo@@ oms are absolutely not made for open water .
so i thought , &quot; i will talk about death . &quot;
so those are not her pe@@ ar@@ l ear@@ r@@ ings . whose are they ?
thank you . thanks very much .
i still remember this decisi@@ ve moment .
india is going to have a lot of young people with a demo@@ graphic divi@@ den@@ d for the next 30 years .
there &apos;s a wire dan@@ gling down either side .
we would finally have a way to give them feedback , as well as the means to act on it .
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective , and i think that &apos;s going to impact technology .
dy@@ s@@ mor@@ ph@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is a per@@ version of this where people who may be very good looking reg@@ ard themselves as hi@@ de@@ ously ug@@ ly and are constantly see@@ king surgery to cor@@ rect their fac@@ ial appe@@ ar@@ ance .

i wish for food for my children .
these were bad years , and people got f@@ ed up with swe@@ den .
you just want to get this one .
you won &apos;t discover anything .
i don &apos;t even use that cl@@ oth to clean my two-@@ wheel@@ er .
i took the first 10,000 she@@ ep that i colle@@ cted , and i put them on a website called thes@@ he@@ ep@@ market@@ .com where you can actually buy colle@@ ctions of 20 she@@ ep .
so if a family suff@@ ers from one co@@ t death , you &apos;d put them in a high-@@ risk group .
ni@@ co@@ le : yes .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
last year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most down@@ lo@@ aded paper by biology letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
but the thing about charles and ray is that they were always mod@@ el@@ ing stuff .
well , if you take the greatest insi@@ ghts from ancient asi@@ an philosop@@ hi@@ es and religi@@ ons , and you com@@ bine them with the lat@@ est research on moral psychology , i think you come to these conclu@@ sions : that our ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous minds were designed by evolution to uni@@ te us into teams , to divi@@ de us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth .
didn &apos;t catch on , unfortunately .
and that &apos;s what they do , radio . that &apos;s what they discovered .
she came to realize that there were a lot of people who &apos;d written patient ad@@ vo@@ cate books that you just don &apos;t hear about at medical con@@ fer@@ ences .
but that &apos;s just the easy part , or ought to be .
this is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
david atten@@ bor@@ ough thinks it &apos;s significant , as the possible beginning of our bi@@ pe@@ d@@ alism .
but as we all sit here today , there are now over 100 toi@@ lets built in this village and a couple ne@@ ar@@ by .

h@@ ong kon@@ g was also the model which leaders like den@@ g xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing could copy , when they decided to move all of the main@@ land towards the market model .
the trees , man@@ gro@@ ve trees , are filled with fire@@ flies communic@@ ating with light .
it &apos;s political . there is so many par@@ ties to this project .
and what was so stri@@ king -- and one of the mes@@ sages i want to leave you here with today -- is the experience .
are you guys ready again -- &quot; the graduate &quot; ?
and he was looking at me . it &apos;s like , yeah , i don &apos;t know if you noticed , but i &apos;m the guy out in the par@@ king lot re@@ creating one of america &apos;s fin@@ est moments with fire ex@@ t@@ ingu@@ is@@ her@@ s .
what comes next in 30 seconds ? i can &apos;t tell you .
there was this big sort of bu@@ mp@@ y-@@ looking virus on the cover , and i just wanted to read it . i picked up that book , and as we dro@@ ve from the edge of the grand c@@ any@@ on to big su@@ r , and to , actually , here where we are today , in mon@@ ter@@ ey , i read that book , and from when i was reading that book , i knew that i wanted to have a life in medicine .
sil@@ ence on the phone .
a viol@@ in@@ ist , as we heard , who has done 10,000 hours of vi@@ o@@ lin practice , some area that contro@@ ls the mov@@ ements of fing@@ ers in the brain change a lot , increasing rein@@ for@@ c@@ ement of the sy@@ nap@@ tic connections .
the u@@ k i know has some very stri@@ ct fire@@ arms laws .
and this is the pu@@ mp .
so it turns out that design for out@@ comes in one aspe@@ ct really means thinking about design for manufac@@ ture and distribution .
and that &apos;s the area again .
and it can collect six million gall@@ ons of rain@@ water in one seas@@ on .
i mean , i thought poetry was just self-@@ expression .
i &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but i want to talk about what i &apos;m doing now . what am i doing now ?
and i &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but i don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because -- however , the &quot; d &quot; in ted of course stands for design .
except for some of the recent announ@@ c@@ ements here in the united states and in europe , it &apos;s an area of consumer protection that &apos;s almost entirely na@@ ked .
that &apos;s beautiful , but let &apos;s face it , nobody talks that way .
showing a series of in@@ spir@@ ing , unusual and play@@ ful products , british brand@@ ing and design gur@@ u paul ben@@ nett explains that design doesn &apos;t have to be about grand gest@@ ures , but can solve small , universal and over@@ looked problems .
i &apos;m a ge@@ ologist by training . but i love that .
so they con@@ sig@@ ned these cur@@ ves to the back of the math books .
but i have to tell you -- and sorry , richard -- but i never did like biology field tri@@ ps much , and i think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years .
now i &apos;d argue that that is as ab@@ sur@@ d as stat@@ ing that 30 minutes of cop@@ u@@ lation is the creative act , and nine months of gest@@ ation , and , god for@@ bi@@ d , 24 hours of child labor is mer@@ ely ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
most education fund@@ ing -- whether it &apos;s k through 12 , or the great universi@@ ties or community colle@@ ges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state bud@@ gets .

mom &apos;s vis@@ iting her kid .
well done .
when we take on top@@ ics like this , it gives us that extra call to reach out to other mov@@ ements and to become more inclu@@ sive and to grow , and we can finally get out of this crazy dile@@ m@@ ma that we &apos;ve been in .
and third , the meaning@@ ful life .
did it point up the degree to which he &apos;d absol@@ ved himself of the crash ?
you &apos;ll notice they all lived , the ones on the top line -- that &apos;s a 100 percent survival rate .
nice . wow . that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever seen that .
and again , some of these may be far@@ -@@ fe@@ t@@ ched , but i figured if there &apos;s anywhere to present far@@ -@@ fe@@ t@@ ched ideas , it &apos;s here at ted , so thank you very much .
you know , when most people think about the diet i re@@ com@@ men@@ d , they think it &apos;s a really stri@@ ct diet .
i mean , it &apos;s really not news for me to tell you that innovation emer@@ ges out of groups .
they lose this stuff that facili@@ tat@@ es this sort of play@@ ful and building mode of thinking .
but if you do take the pl@@ un@@ ge , please remember to turn out the lights .
i killed to get &apos; em , but hey , i don &apos;t care , because now i needs a new jac@@ ket to wear . &quot;
i &apos;d like to talk about a couple of things today .
no water , no life ; no blue , no green .
is there any data to show that child se@@ ats are actually less effective , or just as effective as se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts for serious in@@ j@@ ury ? because that would prove your case . ) steven le@@ vi@@ tt : yeah , that &apos;s a great question . in my data , and in another data set i &apos;ve looked at for new jer@@ sey cr@@ as@@ hes , i find very small differences in in@@ j@@ ury .
i stopped walking , and it took my mind a second to conver@@ t that double negative into a much more horri@@ fying negative .
and your instin@@ ct is to say , &quot; why don &apos;t you su@@ ck an eg@@ g ? &quot;

any place you see a differ@@ enti@@ al , there &apos;re some interesting questions . there &apos;s some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff . but again , coal . maybe the same stuff , maybe the same system , maybe bio@@ energy , and you &apos;re appl@@ ying exactly the same technology .

and of course , we may be wrong -- this hasn &apos;t all been pe@@ er re@@ vie@@ wed , we &apos;re in the middle of thinking about it -- but so far , it seems good .
as a result , we &apos;re tun@@ ed in to the sub@@ t@@ l@@ est things that could possibly be wrong with a computer ren@@ der@@ ing , in order to believe whether these things are reali@@ stic .
look at that picture .
each one gets a color . he goes back into the com@@ position window , dra@@ ws the lines , places everything the way he wants to . looking at the hyper@@ sc@@ ore , you can see it also , you can see where the se@@ ctions are , something might continue for a while , change , get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end .

i think that the chance of life having ar@@ is@@ en on mars , some@@ time in its past , is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half .
and that is , of course , what we are here to talk about .
the dog is actually eu@@ th@@ ani@@ zed now , but this was a dog i worked with for a while .
so , i wanted to play with che@@ e@@ to@@ s in some way .
a couple of different reasons come to mind .
the team from ta@@ i@@ w@@ an was a little bit more ambi@@ tious .
so we took a look at another idea .
so , when we think of hope now , we have to think of looking in other direc@@ tions than we have been looking .
so , we have our gan@@ ges and y@@ am@@ un@@ a cle@@ an@@ up project .
the biggest surprise of disco@@ vering the hig@@ gs bo@@ son ? that there were no surpris@@ es . gi@@ an gi@@ u@@ di@@ ce talks us through a problem in theore@@ tical physics : what if the hig@@ gs field exists in an ultra@@ -@@ den@@ se state that could mean the collapse of all atom@@ ic matter ? with wi@@ t and char@@ m , gi@@ u@@ di@@ ce out@@ lines a gri@@ m fa@@ te -- and why we shouldn &apos;t start wor@@ rying just yet .
and one thing which i found was this black ru@@ b@@ ber .
so we have two prototyp@@ es .
and eventually , we &apos;re going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy .
that &apos;s pu@@ ff pa@@ stry day . why ?
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m calling for here , now : refle@@ ction and , more than that , a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us , what it might be co@@ sting us .
we have 10 million cars by region .
and we need to think about planning a little bit .

but when i come back , i can understand why i shall not do it , because today to not do it , it &apos;s more positive than do it , or how i shall do it .
in the 19@@ th century , when musli@@ ms were looking at europe as an example , they were independent ; they were more self-@@ confi@@ dent .

we &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defined what a word problem is .
i don &apos;t know what in the hell he &apos;s talking about .
my kids are seven , who the hell knows .
and , not only do they protect the people who sleep under them , but they have these great con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on benefits .
so , i decided i would try this for a month .
oh , that &apos;s going to be a disaster waiting to happen .
let us make this field a much bigger place .
but , in fact , if you have cell phones , you can now go to this nice lady who &apos;s somewhere like nam@@ i@@ bia , and who is extremely happy with the fact that although she does not have an master &apos;s degree in electrical engineering from mit , she &apos;s non@@ eth@@ eless able to ha@@ ck her cell phone to get power in some funny way .
then the plan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ e@@ ders , these little dam@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water .
and it &apos;s not just because people would know where the women &apos;s ba@@ thro@@ oms are , even though that would be very hel@@ p@@ ful .
it &apos;s my first year as a new high school science teacher , and i &apos;m so e@@ ager .
so , don &apos;t under@@ esti@@ mate that .
the first building ? well , there &apos;s nobody there .
and now we want to share . that &apos;s the next step .
we were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go , the places nobody else could go , and after three weeks , we realized something . military veter@@ ans are very , very good at disaster response .
so , i hold back a little of my ven@@ om for these astronom@@ ical mis@@ nom@@ ers .
you see some people did beautiful sti@@ pp@@ le ren@@ der@@ ings , like this one on top -- spent a long time making reali@@ stic ver@@ sions .
and what &apos;s happened is they &apos;ve used this learning process to develop a new sign that identi@@ fi@@ es this new social group .
and so , we can say , although not absolutely true , that it &apos;s pretty close to being true .
so , how do you top ro@@ wing across the atlan@@ tic ?
i &apos;ve sat in a lot of those meetings , and by then , it is way too late to use the data .
we are today talking about moral per@@ su@@ asi@@ on .
they have a very high level . it &apos;s coming down .
and this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who know my research and what i &apos;ve done well .
see , my dreams got called names too .
the first group received secon@@ d-@@ line che@@ mo@@ therapy , which is expected to double the life expec@@ tan@@ cy , versus no treatment at all .
in aug@@ ust i &apos;m bringing my sons . &quot;
it is the magic of science .
and there is indeed a fire burning over the earth , taking with it not only plants and animals , but the leg@@ acy of humanity &apos;s brilli@@ ance .
and i said , &quot; no way , i &apos;m not doing it .
now , if you want to understand what happened then when the contin@@ ents broke apart , and dinosaurs found -- land@@ lu@@ b@@ bers , as they are -- found themselves ad@@ ri@@ ft . there &apos;s some missing puzz@@ le pieces .
you didn &apos;t have to be a member then .
so it would all be built in stone , in french li@@ me@@ stone , except for this metal piece .
so i took him into a safe place .
ka@@ -@@ do@@ o@@ o@@ om .
and he said , &quot; we have the co@@ w@@ boys sta@@ tioned at distin@@ ct places all around . &quot;
but it is important to recognize that north korea and south korea started out with iden@@ tical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regu@@ lations , but also in the deeper senses of under@@ stand@@ ings , nor@@ ms , culture , values and belie@@ fs .
we don &apos;t know where they migra@@ te to or from , where they mate , where they have their pu@@ ps , and yet , ham@@ mer@@ head popu@@ lations in the atlan@@ tic have dec@@ lin@@ ed about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years .
and they listen@@ ed to whatever the experts said and took their ad@@ vice , however right or wrong .
and then , as he was doing that , he made an acci@@ dent@@ al click by hit@@ ting the tou@@ ch@@ pad -- you &apos;ll see him do that .
i first learned that my son had been in the world trade center on the morning of september 1@@ 1@@ th , 2001 .
and i do a painting every 20 or 25 years . this is the last one .
so david and i decided to go find out , through the best research we could muster , what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer , to achieve the level of comfort and e@@ ase with the technology that little boys have because they play video games .
you find yourself a mathemati@@ cian ; you find yourself a physi@@ c@@ ist -- somebody who under@@ stands the dynam@@ ics of this flu@@ id .
and yet , we have no energy plan .
if you think about the last time , i dun@@ no , you had a wo@@ b@@ bly to@@ oth .
now , this is a study that followed about 7@@ 0,000 people for 30 years .
de@@ an kamen : the emotion behind invention

this mush@@ room gro@@ ws in washington state , or@@ eg@@ on , northern california , british colum@@ bia , now thought to be extin@@ ct in europe .
its li@@ ver exp@@ ands by eight times .
that &apos;s really what marriage is about .
and these p@@ ills con@@ tain only low do@@ ses of the active ingre@@ dient .
it &apos;s also the biggest risk factor for glau@@ com@@ a , which is just alzheimer &apos;s disease of the eye .
it &apos;s going to dep@@ end if they &apos;re weal@@ thy or im@@ pover@@ ished .
they &apos;ll think it was some kind of a@@ ph@@ ro@@ dis@@ i@@ a@@ c .
it &apos;s called &quot; un@@ ti@@ t@@ led &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
had we cho@@ sen this option , some@@ time around 200@@ ,000 years ago , we would probably still be living like the ne@@ anderth@@ als were when we first enter@@ ed europe 4@@ 0,000 years ago .
but then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
violence has dec@@ lin@@ ed dra@@ matically over the last 500 years .
there &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sent@@ ences on the web .
and it can actually cr@@ ush an empty so@@ da can .
hol@@ y co@@ w ! that &apos;s just amazing .
what does that do to the pay@@ ments and to the interest rates and so forth ?
actually , chris , i was going to pick you for this , but instead of pi@@ cking you , can you ho@@ p up here and pick a vic@@ tim for this next experiment ?
so it turned out that not only was the bil@@ l@@ board still up but they had put this one right next to it .
so , my clo@@ sing thought .
our lives , our cultures , are com@@ posed of many over@@ la@@ pping stories . no@@ ve@@ list ch@@ ima@@ m@@ anda adi@@ ch@@ ie tells the story of how she found her authenti@@ c cultural voice -- and war@@ ns that if we hear only a single story about another person or country , we risk a critical mis@@ understanding .
we re@@ gar@@ ded each other , sc@@ ru@@ tin@@ i@@ zed one another .
t@@ d : so , with reg@@ ard to the development that we &apos;ve been talking about here at this conference , i really feel that the development that we make shouldn &apos;t create a further bur@@ den for us as human beings , but should be used to improve our fundamental lifest@@ yle t@@ d : of course , i re@@ jo@@ ice in the development and the growth and the rise of the no@@ ble land of india , the great country of india , but at the same time , i think , as some of us have ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged , we need to be aware that some aspe@@ cts of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand .
and so conc@@ ern is where all of this comes from .
you take a glo@@ w gene out of a coral or a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and you stick it in a ze@@ bra@@ fish , and , pu@@ ff , they glo@@ w .
then a typical mom respon@@ ds , &quot; stop that non@@ sense . &quot;
these chri@@ sti@@ ans , who are these chri@@ sti@@ ans ?
20 years ago , a new generation of anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects .
and there i really worked as an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce .
another red herr@@ ing might be ex@@ em@@ pli@@ fied by the word &quot; lo@@ ca@@ vor@@ e , &quot; which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dic@@ tion@@ ary .
and they use a red hot ir@@ on need@@ le to make a hole through the mu@@ zz@@ le .
by the end of this year , we would have contribu@@ ted over one million dollars in indi@@ gent care . in the first four months , it &apos;s been 3@@ 4@@ 0,000 dollars , a@@ ver@@ aging 8@@ 5,000 dollars a month . the government will not do that , because they have compe@@ ting needs .
i &apos;m going to tell you why .
you get 12 tou@@ ri@@ sts pac@@ ked into a zo@@ di@@ a@@ c , flo@@ ating in these ic@@ y wat@@ ers , and a le@@ op@@ ard se@@ al comes up and bit@@ es the pon@@ to@@ on .
i was walking through the fore@@ sts of my grandmother &apos;s tal@@ es .
and i met them in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s .
you know , you don &apos;t want to stand there .
there was a burning question though that would not leave me .
do the mon@@ keys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who &apos;s going to do the same thing on every trial , or do they want to be ris@@ ky and try to get a ris@@ ky , but big , bon@@ us , but risk the possibility of getting no bon@@ us .
there are entreprene@@ urs in the ne@@ ther@@ lands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , mar@@ ian pe@@ e@@ ters , who &apos;s in the picture .
putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you &apos;re training for a tri@@ ath@@ l@@ on or prepar@@ ing to give a ted@@ talk , but personally , i think people with the power to de@@ ton@@ ate our economy and ra@@ v@@ age our ec@@ ology would do better having a picture of ic@@ ar@@ us han@@ ging from the wall , because -- maybe not that one in particular -- but i want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time .
we can now des@@ c@@ end thousands of meters into the earth with relative im@@ pun@@ ity .
it might have been something my two gor@@ ge@@ ous dau@@ gh@@ ters had done .
and i said , &quot; yes , men can be difficult , but all women have to get used to that . &quot;
and that &apos;s the way , ultimately after some u@@ ps and dow@@ ns , i ended up designing the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
so let &apos;s get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world .
so anyway , television is , i would suggest , within our gras@@ p .
and it received quite a bit of attention .
and as i said , we don &apos;t know how hard that is . it might be -- after all , most other ma@@ mm@@ als live half as long as the chimpanze@@ e , so we &apos;re sort of three and a half or four times , have four times the lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty of most ma@@ mm@@ als . and in the case of the pri@@ mates , we have almost the same genes . we only diff@@ er from chimpanze@@ es , in the present state of knowledge , which is absolute ho@@ g@@ was@@ h , maybe by just a few hundred genes .
even as me@@ ga@@ -@@ ban@@ ks top@@ ple , ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z says the big re@@ boot is yet to come . but don &apos;t look for it on your bal@@ lot -- or in the stock exchange . it &apos;ll come from science lab@@ s , and it promis@@ es ke@@ en@@ er bodies and minds . our kids are going to be ... different .
so fear showed up as not really the driver .
now what &apos;s powerful about this model is when you bring together all these sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders that represent each link in the chain from in@@ ception of an idea all the way to imple@@ ment@@ ation in the field , that &apos;s where the magic happens .
and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don &apos;t usually have access to design services or creative capital .
and in 19@@ 45 , he published an article in a magazine called atlan@@ tic mon@@ th@@ ly .
and here , the scene of the crime , it &apos;s this place to which he &apos;s never been , but changed his life forever .
it takes tremendous strength of the back to u@@ ph@@ old yourself in the mid@@ st of conditions .
so i f@@ ought my way off my lab@@ el and for my next project with my new band , the grand the@@ ft orche@@ str@@ a , i turned to crow@@ d@@ fund@@ ing , and i fell into those thousands of connections that i &apos;d made , and i asked my crowd to catch me .
so , if we have a quick look at the history of cy@@ ma@@ tics beginning with the obser@@ va@@ tions of res@@ on@@ ance , by da vin@@ c@@ i , g@@ ali@@ le@@ o , the english scientist robert ho@@ ok and then ern@@ est ch@@ la@@ dn@@ i .
and then , what i &apos;m saying is , is that the e@@ ternal predi@@ ction is the out@@ put in the ne@@ o@@ cortex .
so , this is actually a heal@@ thi@@ er ci@@ gar@@ ette .
you &apos;re all c@@ f@@ o , astro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , ultra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out .
and so that &apos;s not going to be a solution that &apos;s going to get us global with bi@@ ologi@@ c tissue .
what about a life ?
in six months , how do we train these women ?
stem cells may be used as building blocks to re@@ pair dama@@ ged sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ds within our body , or to provide new li@@ ver cells to re@@ pair dama@@ ged li@@ ver .
so we hope this year to prototyp@@ e each of these devices .
and so when 4@@ 25 million people finally won the right to choose their own governments , i was ec@@ sta@@ tic , but i was also a touch worried about some of the na@@ sti@@ er things l@@ ur@@ king behind the wall .
and in fact , i want to do a little something impro@@ vis@@ a@@ tional for you here .
and that &apos;s what i hope my com@@ ic stri@@ p does in a small way .
so then we wonder@@ ed , &quot; can they actually man@@ eu@@ ver with this ? &quot;
so , if you &apos;re in the audience today , or maybe you &apos;re watching this talk in some other time or place , you are a partici@@ p@@ ant in the digital rights ecosystem .
but this here , this is not the street .
every time we did a hou@@ se-@@ to-@@ house search , we had a spi@@ ke in the number of repor@@ ts of small@@ po@@ x .

and also , when things go wrong , we try to fix the outside so much , but our control of the ou@@ ter world is limited , temporary , and often , ill@@ us@@ ory .
the only thing they don &apos;t expect is they &apos;re un@@ iting europe through a shared mil@@ d hat@@ red of the french and ger@@ man@@ s .
i adap@@ ted and produced &quot; a dream play &quot; by aug@@ ust str@@ in@@ d@@ berg .
and these were the results of the swe@@ dis@@ h students . i did it so i got the confidence inter@@ val , which is pretty nar@@ row , and i got happy , of course : a 1.@@ 8 right answer out of five possible . that means that there was a place for a professor of international health -- and for my course .
we should be doing something about it .
you guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
so we did an experiment .
this story starts : i was at a friend &apos;s house , and she had on her shel@@ f a copy of the d@@ s@@ m man@@ ual , which is the man@@ ual of mental dis@@ orders .
we have limited input , because he who pa@@ ys the pi@@ per calls the tun@@ e .
we &apos;re not asking for your money . we &apos;re asking for your voice .
it &apos;s going to be machin@@ e-@@ read@@ able .
and to do that , they need a western education .
and i got a lot , like 30 in a half an hour .
&quot; not good . &quot;
you can actually see that kid@@ ney as it was prin@@ ted earlier today .
they were quite proud of the fact that you know , before the d@@ ust cle@@ ars , if some soldi@@ er has been hurt they will have colle@@ cted him or her , they will have brought him back , they will be getting worl@@ d-@@ class tri@@ age emergen@@ cy care faster than you and i would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the united states .
and , very surpris@@ ingly , over half of them had , actually , something to do with design .
&quot; send not for whom the bell toll@@ s . &quot;
this is , like , this is something that in the chinese version has no sou@@ p .
and i &apos;m all set to do it . i &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
have they got something hidden under their clo@@ thing ? what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
so now , how is that ?
there &apos;s the pun@@ k on the ground , pu@@ dd@@ le of blood .
you &apos;re seeing here images of three years , four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , and five-@@ year-old children who have been traff@@ i@@ cked for commercial sexual explo@@ it@@ ation .
the sound quality , or the sound of the sound is how i like to describe ti@@ m@@ b@@ re , t@@ one color -- they cannot tell these things what@@ so@@ ever .
i &apos;m deeply dist@@ ur@@ bed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demon@@ i@@ zing &quot; the other &quot; by the voice we &apos;re giving to the most di@@ visi@@ ve among us .
the epidemic in the friends group has shif@@ ted to the left , over here .
i &apos;m going to use them a different way . &quot;
and hell is down here ? is it a cultural issue ?
think of what that means .
i &apos;m not saying don &apos;t get kids to want to be law@@ yers .
i was optimi@@ zing my life for quality of life , and quality of life for me means time in s@@ now .
the third thing , and this is what wor@@ ries me the most , is the ex@@ tent to which those same lar@@ gely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plu@@ to@@ cra@@ cy also happen to be hol@@ lo@@ wing out the middle class in western industri@@ alized econom@@ ies .
it costs 50 dollars . we can probably make it for 50 cents , if we put our mind to it .
dam@@ on hor@@ o@@ witz : philosoph@@ y in prison
you found an institution , and you use the institution to co@@ ordin@@ ate the activi@@ ties of the group .
and i thought , what about the gest@@ ure of opening the fan , and how simply could i state something .
now &quot; kin@@ dness &quot; might sound like a very mil@@ d word , and it &apos;s pr@@ one to its own ab@@ und@@ ant c@@ liche .
you will read that los z@@ et@@ as is this as@@ sor@@ t@@ ment of soci@@ op@@ a@@ ths that terri@@ fy the cities that they enter and they sil@@ ence the press , and this is some@@ what true , or mostly true .
those are real and they &apos;re in my building every day .
i &apos;ve heard somebody say that you &apos;re as healthy as your gut .
it &apos;s not really what we do , is it , when we &apos;re at our best ?
but he was also consi@@ der@@ ably more conser@@ va@@ tive , consi@@ der@@ ably more anti-@@ foreign , consi@@ der@@ ably more islam@@ ist than we &apos;d like to ac@@ knowledge .
so i also have in the game a s@@ ab@@ ot@@ eu@@ r -- some child -- it &apos;s basically a trou@@ ble@@ maker -- and i have my trou@@ ble@@ maker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
but what that tom@@ b@@ stone should have said , in an alternative lifetime , what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent , was , &quot; here lies the last no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate in physics , who for@@ mul@@ ated the grand uni@@ fied field theory and demon@@ strated the practic@@ ality of war@@ p drive . &quot;
we &apos;re understanding , in fact , that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pus@@ hing towards elimin@@ ating our emissions .
nor is it some sort of indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le mas@@ h .
in the beginning you see the ants just kind of eng@@ aging with the fi@@ ber op@@ tics microscop@@ e .
and people often ask me , is your theory accep@@ ted ?
lots of s@@ now in which to dig a den .
which is why i was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town , getting her sub@@ sequ@@ ent care with her private on@@ c@@ ologist .
it &apos;s your land ; it &apos;s your resource .
so what happens when people win the lot@@ tery is , number one , they spend all the money and go into de@@ bt , and number two , all of their friends and everyone they &apos;ve ever met find them and bu@@ g them for money .
and we &apos;ve also been trying to get computers out to the world , so that groups can communicate much more effectively , campaign much more effectively , but now we have the wonderful possibility , which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it , because that is cheap ; it &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ; and it &apos;s moving fast all around the world -- and it &apos;s very exciting for us .
che@@ mo@@ therapy , one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today , invol@@ ves giving patients really high do@@ ses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells .
this is called the c@@ and@@ le problem .
i &apos;m here to al@@ arm . it &apos;s your job to solve .
this is what happens .
i always end up in the g@@ ents &apos; toi@@ lets .
there we can see fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i numbers related to the golden section , because fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i and golden section rel@@ ate to the un@@ fol@@ ding of the measu@@ red meter of matter , as i re@@ fer to it .
i add two plus two to get four .
in the case of un@@ certain@@ ty , we get it wrong all the time -- and at the very least , we should be aware of that , and ide@@ ally , we might try and do something about it .
and it was very obvious that , if we destro@@ y these sil@@ ent places on earth , we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look out@@ wards , because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from ou@@ ter space .
the original is typically the product of a creative act , the for@@ gery isn &apos;t .
and i feel like you can do it . i have confidence in you .
we are going to win because we don &apos;t understand politics .
so the mon@@ keys get really good at this .
but every time i thought i was beginning to get a hand@@ le on the kor@@ an -- that feeling of &quot; i get it now &quot; -- it would sli@@ p away over@@ night , and i &apos;d come back in the morning wondering if i wasn &apos;t lost in a strange land , and yet the ter@@ rain was very familiar .
they dance , they act -- and the more they do , they are pra@@ is@@ ed .
we might end up with something like this , which is -- i mean , it &apos;s a he@@ ck of a lot better than that .
and then he said , &quot; this is the fo@@ cal l@@ ength . &quot;
i want you to make me famous .
so how do we proce@@ ed in our qu@@ est for happiness ? very often , we look outside .
tour@@ ist : i &apos;ve taken my ste@@ p-@@ daughter here from indi@@ an@@ a@@ poli@@ s .
now , it was not always wonderful at that table .
this will process 2@@ 5,000 li@@ ters of water ; that &apos;s good enough for a family of four , for three years .
he showed how all of this can be put together .
just think about it .
the earth is po@@ is@@ oning our fo@@ ods .
they can be inter@@ cep@@ ted , and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad inten@@ tions .

sop@@ ha@@ l ear : so , not@@ with@@ standing the 197@@ 0s nar@@ ration , on apri@@ l 17@@ th 197@@ 5 we lived in ph@@ no@@ m pen@@ h .
all right , okay .
think about that &apos;s where we are right now , and the cur@@ ve that we &apos;re on means that this is going to continue to get better .
and sorry about that , but this is what turns me on .
the next thing is that , however we design this stuff -- carefully design this stuff -- the street will take it , and will figure out ways to inno@@ v@@ ate , as long as it me@@ ets base needs -- the ability to tran@@ sc@@ end space and time , for example .
now this situation , already i -- you know , i don &apos;t really like thinking about this , although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it . so the point is that we &apos;re very , very inse@@ cure in terms of developing this material .
20 researchers can stand on a bridge sus@@ pen@@ ded inside of the sphere , and be completely immer@@ sed in their data .
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private property rights .
now i was known as &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to listen . &quot;
i had no idea what was in my food , where it came from .
or are we on the ver@@ ge of all being gif@@ ted ?
my mother was like the woman in tom and jer@@ ry .

do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wild@@ life very well ?

now whatever you give up gets tri@@ pl@@ ed in the other person &apos;s account .
first of all , these electro@@ des are non@@ invasi@@ ve .
and as i was coming back , well i was taken by the f@@ bi , met by an f@@ bi ag@@ ent , and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- &quot; where were you ? what were you doing ? who were you talking with ?
this is the kind of commit@@ ment now we &apos;re seeing to try and reach all of the children we &apos;ve been missing .
and i &apos;ve di@@ ved in deep@@ -@@ sea sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles around the world .
look at what &apos;s been achie@@ ved .
i don &apos;t know if people still do that .
because you know what to do about the prote@@ sts .
you know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on soli@@ d ground .
but what about natural forces ?
one , two , three . go !
looking at the oil industry , africa provi@@ des 18 percent of the u.s. &apos; s oil supply , with the middle east just 16 percent .
and so games , for a change , it changes how we see top@@ ics , it changes how our per@@ cep@@ tions about those people in top@@ ics , and it changes ourselves .
the choice in this case is pretty simple .
i tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it .
does industry get to create creatures who , in their milk , in their blood , and in their s@@ ali@@ va and other bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then war@@ e@@ house them as organic manufacturing machines ?
but it &apos;s ug@@ ly .

it recor@@ ds the an@@ nu@@ al rise and fall of green@@ house g@@ ases and temper@@ atures going back before the on@@ set of the last ice ages .
the first is this : that china is not really a nation@@ -@@ state .
that &apos;s the principle obje@@ ctive .
but if what we want is to be like those bu@@ tter@@ flies , to have open-@@ minde@@ dness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
but it &apos;s a totally different sort of process that determin@@ es which ideas spread , and which ones don &apos;t .
it &apos;s like a happiness ad@@ ju@@ sted life@@ -@@ expec@@ tan@@ cy .
and second of all , it requires imagination .
he runs a company called sh@@ anda , which is the largest computer games company in china .

and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher , stor@@ ed it in the only port@@ able memory he has , which is inside his own head , and take it with him , because that is how information was being transpor@@ ted from teacher to student and then used in the world .
we have poli@@ cies that reward spra@@ w@@ l -- we have all kinds of poli@@ cies .
it &apos;s called she@@ ep &apos;s organs .
we look around the media , as we see on the news from iraq , afghanistan , si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , and the conflict seems in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ ble to us .
they get sam@@ sung , how can they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
they did not have any par@@ das inside their body , hi@@ j@@ ab@@ s inside themselves ; they &apos;ve cros@@ sed the bar@@ rier of it .

we &apos;re pro@@ pos@@ ing to do it in just a few hours , once we &apos;ve set up the right chemistry .
and she said , &quot; well , now that i can walk again , i can go back and complete my studies . &quot;
so he sat me down , and he war@@ ned me .

i was told back@@ stage that i have 18 minutes .

and yet , it feels natural to us now .
i would -- if anybody &apos;s got a wh@@ ale skelet@@ on they want to sell me , i &apos;ll put it in the studio .
and it &apos;s a sc@@ ary thing as well . because when we start looking at the collective appe@@ ti@@ te for our lifest@@ y@@ les , and what we &apos;re doing to that landscape -- that , to me , is something that is a very so@@ ber@@ ing moment for me to con@@ temp@@ late .

there &apos;s also a fascinating connection to cancer here , because people with neuro@@ lo@@ gic diseases have a very low inci@@ dence of most can@@ cers .
now , what &apos;s great about this is anybody can do this .
imagine it &apos;s late 199@@ 0 , and you &apos;ve just met a nice young man named tim ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ lee , who starts telling you about his pro@@ posed system called the world wide web . ian ri@@ t@@ ch@@ ie was there . and ... he didn &apos;t buy it . a short story about information , connec@@ tivity and learning from mistakes .
well , let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked .
his family lost everything , and at age 11 , he had to live in mot@@ els with his dad , mot@@ els that would round up all of their food and keep it ho@@ stage until they were able to pay the bill .
designer e@@ mi@@ ly p@@ ill@@ ot@@ on moved to rural ber@@ tie coun@@ ty , in north car@@ ol@@ ina , to engage in a b@@ old experiment of desig@@ n-@@ led community transformation . she &apos;s teaching a desig@@ n-@@ build class called studio h that eng@@ ages high scho@@ ol@@ ers &apos; minds and bodies while bringing smart design and new opportunities to the poor@@ est coun@@ ty in the state .
so what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it &apos;s going to be safe ?
but that spring , there were new bu@@ ds po@@ pping up from the earth .
you may be surprised to find out we don &apos;t need to know very much .
look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she &apos;s going through ? -- and the copy says : &quot; he knows just how to give me goo@@ se@@ bu@@ mp@@ s . &quot;
every row is a student .
liter@@ ature has to take us beyond .
wal@@ -@@ m@@ art has over 1@@ 25 million u.s. custom@@ ers .
i think they said it ta@@ sted like chicken .
when your children and grand@@ children sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they &apos;re gon@@ na ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our clo@@ s@@ est living rela@@ tives , some of the most valuable and en@@ danger@@ ed species on our planet , to go extin@@ ct because we weren &apos;t able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
so that &apos;s it , and we hope to do this in a big way .
one of the most expensive lux@@ ury fo@@ ods by weight in the world .
i actually designed that to move faster through the water because i thought that was the thing that we needed to do : to move fast and get range .
they have a sophisti@@ cated eye which is the fa@@ st@@ est visual system on the planet .
and this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face , and respon@@ ding with a creativity and an adap@@ t@@ ability and an imagination that we really need .
it truly is a parado@@ x@@ ical situation .
i was making my way , let &apos;s say , slowly to oxford , and i went through a news ag@@ ent , and i saw a magazine , a men &apos;s magazine , and it said on the front , &quot; how to bring your partner to or@@ gas@@ m in 30 seconds . &quot;
but i believe that this is a big problem , a problem with poten@@ tially dangerous consequences for us as a society , as a culture and as individuals .
and we humans have been walking up@@ right for only 200 thousand years .
for 20 years , my goal was to let somebody &#91; be &#93; able to use their el@@ bo@@ w and hand in an intui@@ tive way and at the same time .
as su@@ ther@@ land told me , we got to that article , and said , &quot; that &apos;s it . &quot;
we have to do good buildings .
and what happens is when we test people one week later , a month later , three months later , they &apos;re both happ@@ ier and less depres@@ sed .
and this is because our kids are so valuable , not just because of who they are , but because of us , because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection .
and i started to research that top@@ ic , and discovered pro@@ state cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagno@@ sed with it .
fortunately , i did not actually en@@ act that gra@@ ve pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis .
the story is about where you &apos;re arri@@ ving , or thinking about where you &apos;re arri@@ ving .
our school systems are very fla@@ wed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization ; they reward you for a lot of learning and s@@ opp@@ ing up stuff .
and these are the neighbor@@ ho@@ ods , for example , in the central valley of california that weren &apos;t hurt when the hous@@ ing bubble bur@@ st and when the price of gas went up ; they were deci@@ ma@@ ted .
there &apos;s a lot of cros@@ s-@@ pol@@ lin@@ ation . the only problem , especially for the adults working at mc@@ swe@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room .
it &apos;s interesting , isn &apos;t it ? some of us are a little bit more per@@ cep@@ tive than others . it seems that way .
so to un@@ load that great weight -- if that indeed exists -- you can rec@@ line .
and what &apos;s shown here is a sa@@ dd@@ le-@@ sha@@ ped roof that he built that &apos;s 8@@ 7 and a half feet span@@ wise .
if there &apos;s a ca@@ ve in new york that had 15@@ ,000 bat@@ s in it , and there are 1,000 left . that &apos;s like san francisco becoming the population of half of this coun@@ ty in three years .
and we then can re-@@ per@@ f@@ use the li@@ ver with cells , preser@@ ving the blood ves@@ sel tree .
and i want to do it for s@@ uni@@ th@@ a .
and so , i do something i &apos;m tru@@ th@@ fully as@@ ham@@ ed of , which is that i took two dra@@ wings i had made for another purpose and i put them together .
at our time in history , these images are out of place .
so i want to leave that as a thought with you .
they &apos;re kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day .

but i do think it &apos;s only by stopp@@ ing movement that you can see where to go .
how do you cast mu@@ d ?
not a single example of re@@ form has been produced yet .
it &apos;s also extremely surprising to many americans , a hea@@ vi@@ ly afri@@ can@@ -@@ american space .
and if we remember sh@@ ei@@ k@@ h y@@ am@@ an@@ i when he formed op@@ e@@ c , they asked him , &quot; when will we see the end of the age of oil ? &quot;
and there &apos;s a big gap between the task and the movement system .
they do this using principles of physics and chemistry , but they could also be using biology .
also , though we designed it a few years ago -- it &apos;s just become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous in the last year or so -- this he@@ art@@ stream de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ator which is saving lives .
there &apos;s a saying in tor@@ a@@ ja that all people will become grand@@ parents , and what this means is that after death , we all become part of the ance@@ stra@@ l line that an@@ ch@@ ors us between the past and the present and will define who our loved ones are into the future .
so we all get a very di@@ stor@@ ted picture of reality .
your work seems to suggest that that is power@@ fully wrong .

science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
so , it &apos;s a new way of thinking about cancer , it &apos;s a hop@@ e@@ ful way of thinking about cancer .
do people come to you with projects and say , &quot; we want you to do this ! &quot;
most studies of par@@ enting on which this ad@@ vice is based are us@@ eless . they &apos;re us@@ eless because they don &apos;t control for her@@ it@@ ability . they measure some cor@@ relation between what the parents do , how the children turn out and assu@@ me a cau@@ sal relation : that the par@@ enting sha@@ ped the child .
so we went to the teachers .
it turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and en@@ ters into their world .
and sam@@ u@@ el pi@@ er@@ po@@ nt lang@@ ley had , what we assu@@ me , to be the reci@@ pe for success .

what i mean by this is , say he started selling secon@@ d-@@ hand books on ama@@ zon . why should he have to start from scrat@@ ch ?
they &apos;re more comfortable making those intui@@ tive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available .

last i heard , the pre@@ am@@ ble still said , &quot; we , the people of india , &quot; right ?
and i should say that these are three things that we &apos;ve done in ber@@ tie coun@@ ty , but i feel pretty confi@@ dent that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the u.s. and maybe even beyond .
he said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolph@@ in do that .

more importantly , it doesn &apos;t mean it communic@@ ates the right thing .
and we really don &apos;t have experience with pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs , and we &apos;re also not very good as a society at acting to things we don &apos;t have direct and sort of gu@@ t-@@ level experience with .

if you stop a c@@ at from playing -- which you can do , and we &apos;ve all seen how cat@@ s bat around stuff -- they &apos;re just as good predat@@ ors as they would be if they hadn &apos;t played .
all i can say is : i care . i &apos;m a father , and i love this country , and i believe truly , actually , that if change can be made in this country , beautiful things will happen around the world . if america does it , i believe other people will follow .
so you might think there are more interesting things to do , but humor me for the moment .
it doesn &apos;t look like a can of be@@ er , but the design ta@@ ke@@ -@@ off@@ s are absolutely un@@ mista@@ k@@ able .

as part of my work , i &apos;m doing these t@@ ours in different villa@@ ges and to@@ w@@ ns -- 13 , 15 hours on di@@ rt roads -- and there is no community that i &apos;ve gone into that i haven &apos;t seen intelligent girls .
some abilities , of course , de@@ cre@@ ase with age .
now , the interesting thing about that thesis -- if that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil , and all hydro@@ carb@@ ons , turned out to be concent@@ r@@ ated sun@@ light . and if you think of bio@@ energy , bio@@ energy isn &apos;t eth@@ an@@ ol . bio@@ energy is taking the sun , concent@@ r@@ ating it in amo@@ e@@ b@@ as , concent@@ r@@ ating it in plants , and maybe that &apos;s why you get these rain@@ bo@@ ws .

and actually you don &apos;t need to be a ro@@ cket scientist to understand that .
then they can &apos;t get any larger because they don &apos;t have a blood supply , so they don &apos;t have enough oxygen or nutri@@ ents .
in a recent experiment , a group of adults had their brains scan@@ ned in an mr@@ i machine as they were listening to experts speak .
that the cor@@ rect sum@@ mit -- that all of our students , every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics : prob@@ ability and statistics .
we then are able to actually image those , do 3@@ 60 degree ro@@ tation to analy@@ ze the kid@@ ney in its full volu@@ me@@ tri@@ c characteri@@ stics , and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a prin@@ ting compu@@ teri@@ zed form .

and so , in fact , they con@@ co@@ cted a couple of early , you know , fo@@ unding publi@@ c@@ -@@ health interven@@ tions in the system of the city , one of which was called the &quot; nu@@ is@@ an@@ ces act , &quot; which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cess@@ po@@ ols and just po@@ ur all that waste into the river .
so the most wonderful thing , i think , about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we &apos;re having the conversation .
that is my first love , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about .
this was about 19@@ 25 .
now the second lesson that we learned in this is that the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts on this design really push the innovation , because we had to hit such a low price point , because we had to make a device that could travel on many , many types of ter@@ rain but still be us@@ able in@@ do@@ ors , and be simple enough to re@@ pair , we ended up with a fundament@@ ally new product , a new product that is an innovation in a space that really hasn &apos;t changed in a hundred years .
now , all people share the same ra@@ w , adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ a@@ tives .
it was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity .
that &apos;s a lot for a cli@@ ent to com@@ mit to before you actually see the fru@@ i@@ tion of the concept .

for on the surface , ly@@ n@@ don john@@ son should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years , in the sense that he had been ele@@ cted to the pres@@ iden@@ cy ; he had all the money he needed to pur@@ sue any lei@@ sure activity he wanted ; he ow@@ ned a spac@@ i@@ ous ran@@ ch in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , a pen@@ thou@@ se in the city , sa@@ il@@ bo@@ ats , spe@@ ed@@ bo@@ ats .
but i just have to tell you because sometimes i hear your self-@@ dou@@ bt , and it &apos;s so cr@@ us@@ hing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are , how in@@ spir@@ ing and deli@@ ght@@ ful and really , truly the most completely ... &quot;

it was getting more and more appar@@ ent that we &apos;re fighting a losing battle .
you have to be care@@ ful about who you &apos;re sho@@ ot@@ ing at .
this is the environmental conditions on the planet .
and i had a tele@@ phone call from robert lu@@ e at harvard , in the molecular and cell@@ ular biology department , a couple of years ago . he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard .
but also , it &apos;s going to require that we look at our assu@@ mp@@ tions , assu@@ mp@@ tions and stri@@ c@@ tures that we &apos;ve grown up with around democracy , around private capit@@ alism , around what creates economic growth and redu@@ ces poverty and creates free@@ dom@@ s .
for example , in israel , where we emplo@@ y more than 1,000 he@@ c@@ tar@@ es -- 10,000 dun@@ ams in isra@@ el@@ i terms -- of biological p@@ est controll@@ ing swe@@ et pe@@ pp@@ er under protection , 75 percent of the pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des were actually re@@ duced .
and we can ag@@ gre@@ gate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nan@@ o-@@ molecular molecules the same size of dna and proteins , but there &apos;s no carbon in sight .
they don &apos;t feel the push from the ground , is the truth .
it &apos;ll also help us a lot , if we meet an advanced civilization along the way , if we &apos;re trying to be an advanced civilization . number eight -- s@@ p : you &apos;ve got it ! you &apos;ve got the job .
but yet , we get the sen@@ sation of something happening .
so , that &apos;s one general conclu@@ sion about why societies make bad decisions : confli@@ cts of interest .
e@@ o : well , we thank you again for coming to the ted stage .
so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
thank you so much .

so i set up a scientific cri@@ teri@@ a as to what a sen@@ sor would have to look like in order to effectively diagno@@ se pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer .
why are we spending $ 1@@ 35 billion ?
i had to kill my main character , who is a shark .

they commit@@ ted that they &apos;re going to take their exi@@ sting stor@@ es and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent , and their new stor@@ es by 30 percent , and do all that in seven years .
it &apos;s the depen@@ dence on farm sub@@ si@@ dies and under@@ -@@ per@@ forming schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban .
this ab@@ alone sh@@ ell is a bio@@ com@@ posite material that &apos;s 9@@ 8 percent by mass cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate and two percent by mass protein .
and we would visit each other .
am@@ anda , how many were you able to do with the de@@ ka arm ?
so what kind of hor@@ mon@@ es are these ?
now , when we tried to challenge this , going to the su@@ pre@@ me court , getting the su@@ pre@@ me court , the bunch of conser@@ va@@ tives there -- if we could get them to wake up to this -- to stri@@ ke it down , we had the assi@@ stance of no@@ bel prize w@@ inn@@ ers including this ri@@ ght-@@ wing no@@ bel prize w@@ inner , mil@@ ton frie@@ d@@ man , who said he would join our brief only if the word &quot; no bra@@ in@@ er &quot; was in the brief somewhere .
and when i wo@@ ke up the next morning , i was sle@@ eping on a friend &apos;s floor , the only thing i had in the world was a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush i had just bought from an all@@ -@@ night super@@ market .
that &apos;s the mov@@ able part of the sky .

i ta@@ ped it to the top left hand of my table , and as you can see , it &apos;s still there .
and they &apos;ll get a two-@@ child family without a stop in population growth .

and then speak a little bit about how it comes about .
many people have har@@ med me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memor@@ ies grow p@@ ale and fa@@ int in compar@@ ison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
i learned how to effectively communicate across bor@@ ders without being dete@@ cted .
then my teacher said , &quot; really ? well , yo@@ ung@@ -@@ ha , you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for story@@ telling . &quot;
re@@ gar@@ ding the word &quot; patient , &quot; when i first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and atten@@ ding meetings as just a cas@@ ual obser@@ ver , i noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who &apos;s not in the room here , somebody out there .
most people actually go with the pla@@ y-@@ it@@ -@@ safe option .
the appli@@ ance &apos;s safe operating par@@ am@@ e@@ ters are em@@ bed@@ ded into its plu@@ g .
and since i &apos;m a big list maker , i actually li@@ sted them all .
another way to say this , though , is that people who are very liber@@ al are very hard to dis@@ g@@ ust .
she &apos;s be@@ aten .
the first is , &quot; to live , to er@@ r , to fall , to tri@@ um@@ ph and to re@@ create life out of life . &quot;
let &apos;s listen to this song that co@@ ke created for it , &quot; wa@@ v@@ in &apos; fla@@ g &quot; by a som@@ al@@ i hi@@ p ho@@ p artist .
you see , i don &apos;t work with pre@@ stige , so always do mistakes .
and also , like right now , they &apos;re just moving .
we know the tem@@ ples they built , where people could come to experience a different reality .
so our feeling is , if it &apos;s good enough for the ru@@ g@@ by team , it &apos;s good enough for health and poverty .
what happens at ground level , far from the hall@@ s of power , happens to ordinary citizens one by one .
and al-@@ je@@ b@@ r roughly transl@@ ates to &quot; the system for re@@ conc@@ il@@ ing dis@@ par@@ ate parts . &quot;
they wanted us to be concerned about social issues .
are you with child ?
that actually wouldn &apos;t be such a problem , because if we were really all going to die , we would put asi@@ de our differences , we &apos;d spend whatever it took , and we &apos;d find a way to de@@ fle@@ ct them .
my mother fell very ill .
&quot; i have an interest , &quot; you say .
on the top you see the one-@@ step players .
we actually went off to make a boo@@ k@@ mobile .
about three billion people , by the end of this year , will have cell@@ ular connec@@ tivity .
you also have to make sure that it is very difficult to cor@@ ru@@ pt -- that it &apos;s transpar@@ ent .
i think part of the education vari@@ able we talked about before is the net@@ working experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
when a squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l che@@ wed through a c@@ able and kno@@ cked him off@@ line , journalist andre@@ w bl@@ um started wondering what the internet was really made of . so he set out to go see it -- the under@@ water c@@ ables , secret swi@@ t@@ ches and other physical bits that make up the net .
and so if we can learn lessons from the inno@@ v@@ ators in every sector , then in the future we make together , that happiness can be just as u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous as co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a .
and these ideas and narra@@ tives that bu@@ mp people across bor@@ ders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people be@@ have .
but what about that guy ?
that is our regi@@ me , our government -- our at@@ ro@@ cious government , &#91; that &#93; has done every crime in order to stay in power .
this is not a dead body . this is a body who basically , in this particular case , feels the force and tries to protect its head .
this is a science of listening .

ni@@ co@@ le : yes .
reward : this is a more complex and especially integra@@ tive form of our brain with various different elements -- the ex@@ ternal states , our intern@@ al states , how do we feel , and so on are put together .
what the fri@@ gor@@ is you doing ? names are important .
and we did find a lot of stuff .
right from lon@@ el@@ iness to fil@@ ling po@@ th@@ ol@@ es in the street to al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ s@@ m , and 32 children who stopped 16 child marri@@ ages in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than .
and what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and speci@@ alization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
it &apos;s not only inno@@ cent , who i told you about in z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , but defen@@ ders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
but there are more and more technologies , software and processes today that are breaking down those barri@@ ers .
&quot; beh@@ old me , &quot; the god of fren@@ zi@@ ed , in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble love says , ris@@ ing in b@@ loo@@ dy sp@@ l@@ end@@ or , &quot; beh@@ old me . &quot;
and he began building robots .
knowing that a mis@@ sed patient by microscop@@ y infe@@ cts up to 15 people , healthy people , per year , you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives .
the hate mail i get is un@@ belie@@ vable .
the experiments had to be wrong , and they were .
&quot; i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it , &quot; john do@@ er@@ r says in an emotional talk about climate change and investment . to create a world fit for his daughter to live in , he says , we need to invest now in clean , green energy .
so the risks are very great .
let &apos;s call it national e-@@ markets , ne@@ ms for short .
and along comes p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us or another bacteria , stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us and bo@@ om , they get a bacteri@@ al p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia .
and i &apos;ve had for 30 years an interest in a series of comple@@ xi@@ ties where a series of forces are brought to bear , and to understand the nature of the final result of that , repres@@ enting the building itself .
but what if they were po@@ em@@ s and p@@ sal@@ ms ?
these are cars and dri@@ vers . they dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te energy .
bil@@ lie cre@@ pt soft@@ ly into my wa@@ king arms warm like a si@@ p of s@@ our mas@@ h strange fru@@ it for a swe@@ et hun@@ k of tr@@ ash pan@@ ic at the stage door of car@@ ne@@ gie hall &quot; famous ja@@ zz sing@@ er gone a@@ wo@@ l &quot; must have left the building body and sou@@ l on a cre@@ ak@@ y piano sto@@ ol ton@@ ight as the moon is my only wit@@ ness she was brea@@ thing in my ear &quot; this time it &apos;s love &quot; but love is a lo@@ aded pi@@ sto@@ l by da@@ y@@ break she &apos;s gone over the fro@@ zen river , home me and john@@ ny wal@@ ker see in the new age alone stay with me again ton@@ ight bil@@ lie , time , time is a wi@@ ly tri@@ ck@@ ster still an ech@@ o in my heart says , &quot; this time it &apos;s love &quot;
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed , i look at this person and i moment@@ arily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the myster@@ ies that are living right next to me .
we do this by sho@@ ot@@ ing a las@@ er up into the atmosphere , and what we think we can do is if we sh@@ ine a few more that we can cor@@ rect the rest .
it &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for gran@@ ted .
but half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; mm@@ mm@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
this is the blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
at that point , they usually give up .
dis@@ ability is an equ@@ al-@@ opportunity provi@@ der .
the only thing that they can &apos;t copy is the actual tra@@ de@@ mark lab@@ el within that piece of appar@@ el .
so online dat@@ ing is the second most popular way that people now meet each other , but as it turns out , algorith@@ ms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture .
and then they mor@@ ph into violent extre@@ mis@@ m .
so because the fu@@ si@@ form is in@@ t@@ act , the cha@@ p can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot;
she &apos;s the leading arch@@ a@@ e@@ ologist working e@@ aster island today .
but we &apos;ve created a national accoun@@ ting system which is fir@@ m@@ ly based on production and producing stuff .
and as a little girl , i loved the idea of a robot that inter@@ ac@@ ted with us much more like a hel@@ p@@ ful , tru@@ sted si@@ de@@ ki@@ ck -- something that would de@@ light us , en@@ rich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .
that puts a lot of pressure on green@@ land .
and it &apos;s appar@@ ently okay to mar@@ ry a boy from geor@@ gi@@ a , but not to have hair from texas .
that was until the 197@@ 0s , where we had the last energy crisis .
or are you running the same pattern ? because i believe that the invisible force of intern@@ al drive , activ@@ ated , is the most important thing in the world .
so i asked the girls , &quot; how can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fa@@ thers ? &quot;
when you tou@@ ched the cock@@ ro@@ ach leg -- can you get the micro@@ phone for him ?
so i made a more inter@@ active version , and the way i did that is i used their position in time in the lec@@ ture to place these stars into 3d space , and with some cu@@ sto@@ m software and a kin@@ e@@ ct , i can walk right into the lec@@ ture .
why ? because any movement of the super@@ conduc@@ tor will change their place , will change their con@@ figu@@ ration .
nei@@ l h@@ arb@@ is@@ son : i listen to color
now , we can spe@@ cu@@ late and philosop@@ hi@@ ze this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years .
is this science fi@@ ction ? no , because i &apos;m wearing the first app@@ lic@@ ation of this technology .
and , all right , i &apos;m kind of mil@@ king the metaphor a little bit .
and he doesn &apos;t like this first position , but he comes up with a second position , and about 50 minutes later , that nest is finished , and he heads off to for@@ age and pro@@ vision at a pi@@ le of dry dung p@@ el@@ lets .
and at the heart of that economics , we &apos;re plac@@ ing a more cre@@ di@@ ble , more rob@@ ust , and more reali@@ stic vision of what it means to be human .
some images from mars , 199@@ 7 .
on a trip through india , early in his rei@@ g@@ n as king , he was asked by an indian journalist about the b@@ hu@@ tan@@ ese g@@ dp , the size of the b@@ hu@@ tan@@ ese g@@ dp .
all those things do is change who pa@@ ys .
so the government decided to have the elec@@ tions once again .
they di@@ gest our food , they make our vi@@ tam@@ ins , they actually educ@@ ate your imm@@ une system to keep bad micro@@ bes out .
because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have cho@@ sen to interact with .
what we believe , obviously -- and you know this -- determin@@ es our behavior , and our behavior determin@@ es what we become in life .
look at what he is doing .
these lich@@ ens grow only one centi@@ meter every hundred years .
so the whole thing can g@@ ently move when the wind blo@@ ws .
in the years that she walked , she educ@@ ated parents , mothers , fa@@ thers .
but why is it so hard to slow down ?
they switch really fast , very swi@@ ft@@ ly . they pay a very small cost .
when you educ@@ ate a girl , she ten@@ ds to have signific@@ antly fewer kids .
but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing .
at the very end of it , i showed a list under that ti@@ tle .
it &apos;s like every year it &apos;s the last minute that we can do something about the war with iran .
the ted people will kill me , but perhaps there &apos;s time for one en@@ core .
so i went back to the store and said to the ow@@ ner , &quot; i love the shoes , but i hate the l@@ ac@@ es . &quot;
so i am a 21@@ st-@@ century transl@@ ator of technology into products that we use everyday and rel@@ ate beauti@@ fully and naturally with .
what &apos;s happening increasingly , though , is these systems are beginning to use the internet .
because they became my only friends , they became my friends , because very few people that i knew -- well , i wasn &apos;t sent a lot of cards or flo@@ wers . i mean , if i had had a broken leg or i was with child i would have been in@@ und@@ ated , but all i got was a couple phone calls telling me to per@@ k up .
my passion , and what i &apos;ve spent the last few years de@@ dic@@ ated to resear@@ ching , is the collabor@@ ative behaviors and tru@@ st-@@ mechan@@ ics in@@ her@@ ent in these systems .
there &apos;s a huge dis@@ connect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical .
and that &apos;s why we continue to gra@@ b technology -- because we want those things . those things are good .
so for 11 years , i con@@ formed .
because old and ancient as it may be , it &apos;s very complicated and it &apos;s very simple , both at the same time .
the garage on the right -- the gra@@ y structure -- will be tor@@ n down , finally , and several small class@@ rooms will be placed along this a@@ venue that we &apos;ve created , this cam@@ pus .
well , the result has been very good .
they choose to leave their homes in order to ear@@ n money , to learn new skills , and to see the world .
he lived into his 8@@ 0s , and he was bu@@ ried bene@@ ath this mon@@ um@@ ent in 7@@ 20 ad .
so you were for@@ war@@ ding on . you didn &apos;t have control .
i think they &apos;re right that evolution is fundament@@ ally ho@@ sti@@ le to religion .
l@@ m : ten years ago , when i had my surgery -- and it &apos;s really great to see him .
the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating mira@@ cles because of their commit@@ ment .
wat@@ son was in fact listening to very low-@@ frequ@@ ency radio emissions caused by nature .
happy ted . it &apos;s so wonderful here . i love it . i love it . i love it .
no co@@ inci@@ dence that these were taken by ro@@ b k@@ es@@ sel@@ er , who is an artist , and i think it &apos;s someone with a design and arti@@ stic eye like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen .
you couldn &apos;t den@@ y -- if someone wanted to link to you , you couldn &apos;t stop them . you had to participa@@ te in this idea of opening up your pages to be lin@@ ked by anybody .
&quot; asi@@ de from the beautiful music , it &apos;s great just to know i &apos;m part of a worldwide community of people i never met before , but who are connected anyway . &quot;
but , that is ben@@ jam@@ in . thank you .
or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und bus or a vehicle .
but haiti provi@@ ded us with something else un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented .
it was always part of how they looked at the world . and that &apos;s what &apos;s really powerful .
so , based on that success , the following year we did the pro@@ per mechan@@ ical design starting from kin@@ e@@ ma@@ tics .
it is the story factory , one of the very best in the world .
we are the stories we tell ourselves .
in the 20th century , it was tot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism .
six years after the u.s. invasi@@ on of iraq , the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality .
each of us , with a single step , can take the world , can bring the world a step closer to peace .
three years later , we have the peri@@ meter institute for theore@@ tical physics in water@@ lo@@ o , on@@ t@@ ari@@ o . it &apos;s the most exciting job i &apos;ve ever had .
this is at 3,000 feet in mon@@ ter@@ ey c@@ any@@ on .
but i do have an idea , and that idea is called hous@@ ing for health .
the che@@ e@@ ta@@ h generation is a new bre@@ ed of afri@@ cans who bro@@ ok no non@@ sense about corruption .
our cars have sensor@@ s by which they ma@@ gi@@ cally can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspe@@ ct of driving .
will you have a go for me ?
people can te@@ ar it , tag on it , or even pe@@ e on it -- some are a bit high for that , i agree -- but the people in the street , they are the cur@@ ator .
ultimately , especially now in this world , where we live in a context of re@@ gressi@@ ve and on@@ er@@ ous im@@ migra@@ tion laws , in reality tv that thri@@ ves on hu@@ mili@@ ation , and in a context of analysis , where the thing we hear most repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , da@@ y-@@ in , da@@ y-@@ out in the united states , in every train station , every bus station , every plane station is , &quot; ladies and gentle@@ men , please report any sus@@ pi@@ cious behavior or sus@@ pi@@ cious individuals to the auth@@ ori@@ ties ne@@ ar@@ est you , &quot; when all of these ways we are encoura@@ ged to view our fellow human being with ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty and fear and con@@ temp@@ t and sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ on .
and so 15 years , actually , and about four billion dollars later , the genome was sequen@@ ced and published .
i have my entire new york city board of education tran@@ scri@@ pt from kinder@@ garten through college .
if they then mix@@ ed with each other there , then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa car@@ ried with them this ne@@ anderth@@ al compon@@ ent in their genome to the rest of the world .
and how are we going to get those kids those nutri@@ tious fo@@ ods ?
in some states , sen@@ ior water rights hol@@ ders can leave their water in-@@ stream while leg@@ ally prote@@ cting it from others and main@@ tain@@ ing their water right .
how do we enter that feeling of res@@ on@@ ance , how do we enter another person &apos;s being ?
as it was the cu@@ sto@@ m of the time , c@@ oper@@ ni@@ c@@ us was actually simply bu@@ ried in an un@@ mar@@ ked gra@@ ve , together with 14 others in that ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
on the other hand , try to say that this is not the case , because there is a scientific con@@ sen@@ su@@ s about this pattern now .
this brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race .
and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this vari@@ ation makes you more sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to diseases , or does this vari@@ ation just make you different ?
a ger@@ man prison camp .
thank you .
this was not an oral history program .
so ro@@ me effectively wa@@ ged war on places like car@@ th@@ age and eg@@ y@@ pt just to get its pa@@ ws on their grain reser@@ ves .
oh , they gla@@ dly sell you that , yes .
now what would this mean , and how would we do it ?
that video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today i have travel@@ ed to almost 20 cities and photograph@@ ed almost 2,000 people .
but it does . generally , we haven &apos;t got ourselves into this m@@ ess through big dis@@ ast@@ ers .
we can even add micro@@ process@@ ors and have this as an input and create squ@@ ish@@ y sound music that we &apos;ve done .
and yet , one is a ch@@ im@@ p , and the other is a co@@ w .
and then the c@@ liche came to ha@@ unt us .
it &apos;s gone now . &quot;
you have to have low cost , but you also have to have a function .
so the final experiment that i want to mention to you is our fair@@ ness study .
and yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
and we &apos;re going to do it again in the next 25 years .
maybe it &apos;s evolved from coming down from trees , and trying to control a gli@@ de .
so , i walked very comfort@@ ably to this mis@@ sion@@ ary school that was run by an american mis@@ sion@@ ary , and the first thing the american mis@@ sion@@ ary gave me was a c@@ and@@ y .
and thank you for listening .
i guess in plu@@ ral it &apos;s sc@@ ro@@ tal , like medium and media .
it &apos;s called a lo@@ bot@@ om@@ y .
we know how to solve di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and san@@ it@@ ation , but if you look at the bud@@ gets of countries , developing and developed , you &apos;ll think there &apos;s something wrong with the math , because you &apos;ll expect ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties like pakistan spending 4@@ 7 times more on its military than it does on water and san@@ it@@ ation , even though 15@@ 0,000 children die of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a in pakistan every year .
i was talking to one of them , and he was really li@@ king this arm -- it &apos;s way , way , way better than a plastic stick with a ho@@ ok on it -- but there &apos;s nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got .
there &apos;s something else at play here .
it doesn &apos;t need to be re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated , it doesn &apos;t need water , which is often l@@ ac@@ king .
this is a tremend@@ ously complicated process .
i don &apos;t know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
thank you .
so , i come back to my ini@@ tial point .
and i mean by this -- and you may say , by the way , &quot; look , i &apos;m good .
although , to be sure , the repu@@ tation system , at the moment , works that you leave your report after the cou@@ ch sur@@ fing experience , so there may be some sele@@ ction bi@@ as there .
they &apos;re very mobile . you cannot ta@@ x them .
so by now , i had developed a new pe@@ da@@ go@@ gical method , so i applied that . i said , &quot; i haven &apos;t the f@@ og@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot;
we now live in a connected age where we can lo@@ cate anyone , any@@ time , in re@@ al-@@ time , from a small device in our hands .
and i want to tell you a quick story about 199@@ 9 -- a video game called ever@@ qu@@ est .
chan@@ ting : one united nation .
actually , there was an appe@@ al worldwide for new dete@@ c@@ tors sustainable in the environments where they &apos;re needed to produce , which is main@@ ly in the developing world .
audience : no .
i was a pris@@ on@@ er and i needed to es@@ cape .
and what we could use as a bin@@ der was actually small amo@@ unts of co@@ w man@@ ure , which they used ordin@@ arily for their fuel .
and coming up next month is actually future med , a program to help cros@@ s-@@ train and le@@ verage technologies into medicine .
and it all started almost a decade ago , as a young consu@@ l@@ t@@ ant at m@@ ck@@ inse@@ y &amp; amp ; company at their first african office in jo@@ han@@ nes@@ bur@@ g .
we occasi@@ on@@ ally st@@ um@@ ble onto a page in chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
and we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well -- sort of these auto@@ -@@ pa@@ ge-@@ turning things .
everyone was sc@@ ared .
well , i &apos;m really bo@@ ther@@ ed by the fact that anybody would think that was hil@@ ari@@ ous .
now , the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of re@@ struc@@ turing , that what the web is doing is re@@ struc@@ turing .
okay , so what is the da@@ f-@@ 2 re@@ cep@@ tor telling the inside of the cell ?
he had a less@@ er charge of for@@ gery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the du@@ tch people .
this is not always good , because what is your perfect world ?
each will have a pan@@ -@@ african student body , but speci@@ alize in a different area of science .
suppose we appro@@ x@@ ima@@ ted one person with one book ?
and i actually made up a little character whose name was mr. alli@@ g@@ ator , and i would call him up when things got really bad , and i would say it was time to come and pick me up .
if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you know what i mean .
i &apos;ve explor@@ ed , experienced , and experim@@ ented enter@@ prise and capit@@ alism to my heart &apos;s content .
rb : of course .
i did puzz@@ les for &quot; be@@ je@@ wel@@ ed . &quot;
here we have the descri@@ ption of the order of nature .
and if you do happen to be on the for@@ bes 400 list , talking about income distribution , and inevi@@ t@@ ably its cou@@ sin , income re@@ distribution , can be down@@ right thre@@ at@@ ening .
yes , there &apos;s issues about how money should be distribu@@ ted , and that &apos;s still being re@@ figured out .
how are they enti@@ t@@ led to practice ?
and that would be to create a kind of three-@@ dimensional bubble -- a really interesting over@@ co@@ at that would naturally venti@@ late , would brea@@ the and would seriously reduce the energy lo@@ ads .
women are moving back into the job market .
he p@@ aus@@ ed and put his hands together and said , &quot; yes , gre@@ g , but the de@@ vil will be in the details , &quot; he said .
and so we &apos;re actually here to protect you .
this is maybe a little tough .
here &apos;s who put them up and who are a@@ vid pen@@ cil users .
about 200 years before , fran@@ c@@ is bac@@ on and then , later , is@@ a@@ a@@ c new@@ ton , had pro@@ posed an in@@ duc@@ tive scientific method .
other lab@@ s have actually looked at this as well using different meas@@ ures of dis@@ g@@ ust sensi@@ tivity , so rather than asking people how easily dis@@ gu@@ sted they are , they ho@@ ok people up to physi@@ ological meas@@ ures , in this case skin conduc@@ tan@@ ce .
i &apos;m going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials .
we will look for me@@ than@@ e as well as other gas@@ ses produced by living systems .
everything goes into it .
so , are you ready for the lec@@ ture ?
it &apos;s a universal thing -- we play .
and then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that mo@@ ther@@ ly possibility .
they could be po@@ sted through the web ; they could be used as a bil@@ l@@ board or a bus shel@@ ter , or anything of that nature .
it &apos;s this absolutely phenomen@@ al dis@@ ruption of the imm@@ une system that is the key to why people die of this virus .
you couldn &apos;t sell co@@ ca@@ ine .
and what all this means is that paradig@@ ms take far too long to shift , that complexity and nu@@ ance are ignor@@ ed and also that money talks -- because we &apos;ve all seen the evidence of pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical companies fund@@ ing studies of drugs that conven@@ i@@ ently leave out their worst side effects , or studies fund@@ ed by food companies of their new products , massi@@ vely ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the health benefits of the products they &apos;re about to bring by market .
the result is whether you &apos;re looking at the west or the eastern blu@@ ef@@ in population , there &apos;s been tremendous dec@@ line on both sides , as much as 90 percent if you go back with your bas@@ eline to 19@@ 50 .
they collect 100 thousand li@@ ters in one seas@@ on .
they kind of have this v@@ au@@ lt where they &apos;re stor@@ ed in high-@@ de@@ f , and george lu@@ c@@ as did all the sound effects .
and the thing about it , i &apos;ve done this for years , the yo@@ unger they are , the more fun it is .
f@@ g : i don &apos;t really know .
what are we supposed to do ?
it &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open licen@@ ses has also never been che@@ aper or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
here &apos;s a diagra@@ m of the p@@ c@@ b load of dolph@@ ins in sar@@ as@@ ota bay .
now which one of these looks od@@ d to you ?
cas@@ ual speech is something quite different .
the assu@@ mption is that the basic law really takes the form of a uni@@ fied theory of all the particles .
and you know what these are .
oh , what a joy it has been to be a person see@@ king to tan@@ gi@@ bili@@ tate compassion .
and if we can trans@@ late that into our built environment , then there &apos;s some exciting potential for the way that we build things .
can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning b@@ ent down to their child and hu@@ g@@ ged their child and said , &quot; de@@ ar , i &apos;ll be back later .
first place i &apos;d like to take you is what many believe will be the world &apos;s deep@@ est natural ab@@ y@@ ss .
now we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing one every week .
w@@ k : yeah .
so , how can we still stay imm@@ une ?
right ? that would explain it , right ?
in america , our aging , dir@@ ty and inse@@ cure power system has to be re@@ placed anyway by 20@@ 50 .
and he wouldn &apos;t buy a newspaper from me ever .
and those have been lin@@ ked then with the rather al@@ ar@@ ming , growing rates of o@@ bes@@ ity , shown in these maps here , and that o@@ bes@@ ity has also been tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing great incre@@ ases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-@@ in-@@ three chance of developing diabetes .
americans spent , in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pe@@ sti@@ cide use was done on law@@ ns .
the graph was interesting , although you need to consider it carefully .
but we are also invest@@ ing around another 300 million dollars this year to ex@@ tend that co@@ verage .
we &apos;ve been just feet apart . i &apos;m going back down now . &quot;
so we picked up on that and we said , &quot; you know , we now have the ability to look inside human beings with these special ca@@ the@@ ters called i@@ v@@ us : in@@ tra@@ vas@@ cular ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und . &quot;
so , we gave it all back , and then we set up three foun@@ da@@ tions , working on some of the major problems of the world : il@@ liter@@ acy , poverty , pan@@ de@@ mic diseases -- particularly hiv / aids -- and set up these three foun@@ da@@ tions , and put the money into that .
and bl@@ ess yourself . thank you very much .
these are great ideas , villa@@ ge-@@ level ideas .
it &apos;s great that we have initi@@ a@@ tives to say , let &apos;s go create the education and educ@@ ate people in the world , because that &apos;s a great force for peace .
and let &apos;s start with radical incre@@ ases in resource efficiency .
h@@ ence , you could share some of your nutri@@ tional resources instead of mon@@ o@@ poli@@ zing them .
the message for marketing is that your brand is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
for example , our national en@@ dow@@ ment for the arts , with its $ 150 million budget , s@@ las@@ hing that program would immediately reduce the national de@@ bt by about one one-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th of a percent .
with this event , a new era in na@@ tive american history began .
so can life be defined ?
he is just going to use his hand , his body and his voice , just like humans interact with their hands , body and voice .
&quot; pun@@ k farm , &quot; &quot; bag@@ head , &quot; &quot; oll@@ ie the pur@@ ple eleph@@ ant . &quot;
we couldn &apos;t leave any tra@@ ces behind .
and i wanted to give up .
okay . another fe@@ ature of consciousness is that it comes in uni@@ fied conscious fields .
in a matter of five or six years , they have a forest , the soil is en@@ rich@@ ed , and the village is saved .
hu@@ gely successful .
these animals have within them the lat@@ ent capacity to live much longer than they normally do .
we found spec@@ tac@@ ular new species , the most beautiful and visu@@ ally stun@@ ning things everywhere we looked -- from the shor@@ eline to the ab@@ y@@ ss , form micro@@ bes all the way up to fish and everything in between .
the metal in the sin@@ k is conduc@@ tive .
and the kind of sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ es i &apos;m talking about are , fir@@ stly , both these technologies work very well in hot , sun@@ ny deser@@ ts .
and then we went up and met their sha@@ man .
and the reason that that &apos;s relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tri@@ be , which looks like this .
cognitive resear@@ cher nan@@ cy et@@ co@@ ff looks at happiness -- the ways we try to achieve and increase it , the way it &apos;s un@@ te@@ ther@@ ed to our real circum@@ stances , and its surprising effect on our bodies .
one lin@@ ear , one cy@@ cli@@ cal .
how many people does he emplo@@ y to service that population ?
david per@@ ry : the thing again i want you to think about is , don &apos;t look at these graphi@@ cs and think of that &apos;s the way it is .
ss : researchers are hop@@ ing to present their studies to the f@@ da this summer .
how could they say that we as a group were not deser@@ ving of equal rights as somebody else ?
i also didn &apos;t want anybody to question it .
that was fortun@@ ate for me , because in most press photos i appear too , although often between sophi@@ a &apos;s legs .
and the thought was , &quot; make it go away ! &quot;
i was all set to do it and i was thinking , &quot; a@@ w man , &quot; i was just going to im@@ pose upon the power@@ s that be , and measure the speed of light .
fir@@ ms produce goods for hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds -- that &apos;s us -- and provide us with in@@ comes , and that &apos;s even better , because we can spend those in@@ comes on more goods and services .
another photo that has great@@ ly influ@@ enced me , or a series of photos , is this project that &apos;s done by an ar@@ gent@@ ine@@ an man and his wife .
this is a very , very low level in order to be ki@@ cked out of the health care system .
and he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of survi@@ ving this century .
this is man &apos;s first attemp@@ t at flying under@@ water .
but for the rest of my life , if i meet john ho@@ d@@ g@@ man at a ted party , i don &apos;t have to say , &quot; i &apos;m a computer scientist . &quot;
i get that all the time in du@@ bai .
here in the united states we spend more money per person for out@@ comes that are not better than many countries in the world .
and there &apos;s another pattern here as well . can you spot it ?
so the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region , the right t@@ p@@ j , being used while children are thinking about other people .
had the children e@@ aten bo@@ iled s@@ wee@@ ts ?
they were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of protein ser@@ ved with cop@@ i@@ ous quanti@@ ties of vege@@ tables and small amo@@ unts of star@@ ch , usually ri@@ ce .
and so we &apos;ve just ad@@ ded this man@@ ual bel@@ lo@@ ws .
and , not only can they read them , but they copy them .
al gore really would have had to invented the internet .
and i had in@@ cess@@ ant fun making fun of him in the training room because he &apos;d come in with foot in@@ ju@@ ries .
but , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in ser@@ ving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
why ? because during conflict economic policy typically de@@ teri@@ or@@ ates .
so these are not particularly intelligent creatures , and yet , as we &apos;ll see , they exhi@@ bit beautiful bal@@ lets .
but the statisti@@ cal result is l@@ oud and clear .
i want you to imagine that this particular grou@@ ping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continu@@ ation of the human race .
the tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil has shown us that , not only can cancer be a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease , but it can also thre@@ aten an entire species with extin@@ ction .
if you add it all up what do you get ?
right now , those and other neuro@@ lo@@ gic diseases -- for which we have no cure or pre@@ ven@@ tion -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year .
let &apos;s take an example .
we could use some more help to do this , but think of what it would mean if we could have a worl@@ d-@@ class health system in r@@ wand@@ a -- in a country with a less@@ -@@ than@@ -@@ one-@@ doll@@ ar-@@ a-@@ da@@ y-@@ per@@ -@@ capit@@ a income , one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every simil@@ arly situ@@ ated country on earth .
no calcul@@ us , i &apos;ll cut out that .
it &apos;s a website where we , and anyone else who wants to join us , share experiments , publi@@ sh information , encoura@@ ge others to contribu@@ te whenever they can , and ag@@ gre@@ gate resources such as research pa@@ pers and tu@@ tor@@ i@@ als by other makers like ourselves .
he gave us a new perspective on life . &quot;
ted has always cele@@ br@@ ated what technology can do for us , technology in its finished form .
so let me see .
by 2010 , college gradu@@ ates , if you said two cir@@ cles followed by a se@@ mi@@ circle , two six@@ te@@ ens followed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 .
audience : you had , i hope you had -- ed : now you &apos;ve been to the website dogs of sa@@ int lou@@ is in the late , in the mi@@ d-@@ 19@@ 30 &apos;s , then you &apos;d know that was a great dan@@ e .
but i had an ul@@ teri@@ or mo@@ tive of vis@@ iting got@@ t@@ fri@@ ed sch@@ lau@@ g , and it was this : that i was at a cro@@ ss@@ roads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
there were wee@@ ds and pil@@ es of g@@ arb@@ age and other stuff that i won &apos;t mention here , but she kept dra@@ g@@ ging me -- and l@@ o and beh@@ old , at the end of that lot was the river .
they should be equal , have no reason to be closer to one african than another african .
this is a block diagra@@ m of a model and simulation of the human audi@@ tory cortex that actually works quite well -- in appl@@ ying psycho@@ ac@@ ou@@ stic tests , gets very similar results to human audi@@ tory perception .
they &apos;re healthy ; they &apos;re clean -- it &apos;s amazing .
so it &apos;s like the different la@@ yers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity .
the military of the arc@@ tic nations is taking it really seriously .
even tri@@ ps to the den@@ ti@@ st require that you take antibio@@ tics , in case you get an intern@@ al infe@@ ction on the val@@ ve .
they are dig@@ ging in . and they &apos;re looking for ways to extra@@ ct value out of every pur@@ ch@@ ase that they make .
when we sub@@ mit@@ ted it for the swe@@ dis@@ h competition we thought it was a really cool sche@@ me , but it didn &apos;t exactly look like something from the north of swe@@ den .
it &apos;s the institutions .
so we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system , more as if this wasn &apos;t a large organis@@ m that we are going to be inter@@ acting with . it &apos;s a &quot; one . &quot;
a quote by ber@@ tr@@ and rus@@ sell , &quot; all the labor of all the ages , all the de@@ vo@@ tion , all the inspiration , all the no@@ on@@ day bri@@ ght@@ ness of human geni@@ us are dest@@ ined to extin@@ ction .
we all know about the al@@ bert einstein who came up with e = mc@@ 2 .
and if that &apos;s not enough , s@@ mil@@ ing can actually make you look good in the eyes of others .
and you can see , he &apos;s working between docum@@ ents and graphi@@ cs and so forth .
he was in some sort of cat@@ at@@ onic state where he could be aware of his surro@@ und@@ ings , but couldn &apos;t even blin@@ k to indi@@ cate that he was alive .
when i first saw his picture , i thought that these super@@ power@@ s came from his super coll@@ ar .
and j@@ ill and kev@@ in , the happy couple , they came back from their hon@@ e@@ y@@ moon and found that their video had gone crazy vi@@ ral .
ri@@ ta pi@@ er@@ son , a teacher for 40 years , once heard a collea@@ gue say , &quot; they don &apos;t pay me to like the kids . &quot; her response : &quot; kids don &apos;t learn from people they don &apos;t like . &apos; &quot; a r@@ ous@@ ing call to educ@@ ators to believe in their students and actually connect with them on a real , human , personal level .
and that &apos;s why i believe that if you live your life with a great at@@ titude , choo@@ sing to move forward and move on whenever life de@@ als you a b@@ low , living with a sense of awareness of the world around you , embra@@ cing your inner three year-old and seeing the tiny jo@@ ys that make life so swe@@ et and being authenti@@ c to yourself , being you and being cool with that , le@@ tting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satis@@ fy you , then i think you &apos;ll live a life that is rich and is satis@@ fying , and i think you &apos;ll live a life that is truly a@@ wes@@ ome .
they had to rec@@ ru@@ it teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison , they had to establi@@ sh stri@@ ct separ@@ ation between the people who work at the school and the prison auth@@ ori@@ ties , and most da@@ un@@ t@@ ingly of all , they needed to inv@@ ent a new cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um because you know what ?
and i realized that the whole em@@ pi@@ re was likely to come cr@@ as@@ hing down unless i chi@@ pped in a chip .
secon@@ dly , from the &#91; au@@ stri@@ an &#93; an@@ arch@@ ist philosop@@ her paul fe@@ y@@ er@@ abend , facts are relative , and what is a massive right of self-@@ reli@@ ance to a nigeri@@ an busin@@ es@@ sper@@ son is considered un@@ auth@@ ori@@ zed and horri@@ ble to other people , and we have to recognize that there are differences in how people define things and what their facts are .
it &apos;s using this as risk control , not instead of action .
how can this be made better ?
we end up within these filter bub@@ bles , as my friend el@@ i par@@ is@@ er calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
but the real issue is that we are gui@@ ded by our limited experience , and until we can think out of the box of our cr@@ ani@@ um and what we know , then we can &apos;t recognize what to look for , or how to plan for it .
every being , even the most mean looking ones , can be mo@@ ther@@ ly .
because that &apos;s where all the ocean is . &quot;
it squ@@ ee@@ ze the mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure hidden in the sand .
not in the middle east .
and , &quot; how s@@ wollen is your vul@@ va ? &quot;
i better shu@@ t up .
it has social and psych@@ ological a@@ ims -- family , friend@@ ship , commit@@ ments , society , partici@@ p@@ ating in the life of that society .
you can also see the evolution of the one-@@ chil@@ d-@@ only policy as it tra@@ vels through the b@@ loo@@ d@@ line .
many of us will remember our childhood growing up , maybe you got stung by a be@@ e , you saw bees on flo@@ wers .
so i sent this company an email saying , &quot; hell@@ o . i &apos;m chri@@ sti@@ en . i &apos;m doing this research .
but the other thing that i thought would be fantastic was to create these -- call them &quot; prize tar@@ gets . &quot;
lunch ladies treat me really well .
and i would like it to be ethi@@ op@@ ia .
so , they &apos;re learning from each other . and research be@@ ars this out .
in other words , it &apos;s kind of random , kind of ad ho@@ c , how we figure out what we should do .
the compar@@ ison changes how we ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate him .
it &apos;s bringing the cells into the body . it &apos;s allo@@ wing the cells to re@@ generate new tissue , and once the tissue is re@@ gener@@ ated the sc@@ aff@@ old goes away .
it meant paying with op@@ ium for chinese goods .
we live in a digital world , but we &apos;re fairly anal@@ o@@ g creatures .
and here &apos;s one that does conc@@ ern me .
between no@@ v@@ ember and may , rio &apos;s completely pac@@ ked .
you see , the streets are clear .
new materials that can make water , new materials that can make fuel cells work better , new materials that cat@@ aly@@ ze chemical re@@ actions , that cut pollution and so on .
and i conclu@@ ded , after resear@@ ching every other technology that we could de@@ plo@@ y for stor@@ ing energy -- fl@@ y@@ whe@@ els , different for@@ mu@@ lations of bat@@ ter@@ ies -- it just wasn &apos;t practical to store energy .
should i be pro@@ -@@ technology ? should i embra@@ ce it full arms ?
and i realized : i don &apos;t want to reach these people .
tim brown says the design prof@@ ession has a bigger role to play than just creating ni@@ f@@ ty , fashi@@ on@@ able little objects . he calls for a shift to local , collabor@@ ative , partici@@ pat@@ ory &quot; design thinking &quot; -- starting with the example of 19@@ th-@@ century design thin@@ ker is@@ am@@ b@@ ard king@@ dom br@@ un@@ el .
for the first time , you &apos;ll have ac@@ tors that really feel very inter@@ active , that have real bodies that really re@@ act .
as a boy , i was te@@ ased by my si@@ sters and by scho@@ ol@@ boys , but not by george .
that is a picture of my mother , and she recently got a facebook account .
we have no uni@@ form poli@@ cies re@@ gar@@ ding quar@@ ant@@ ine across the united states .
but being less diver@@ se is not necessarily good for our health .
this one is an antibio@@ tic .
a message written on a sti@@ cky note to my mom on paper can come to an sms , or maybe a meeting remin@@ der auto@@ matically syn@@ cs with my digital cal@@ end@@ ar -- a to-@@ do list that auto@@ matically syn@@ cs with you .
and you have to guess my mind . so you are under tremendous pressure because i don &apos;t give you instru@@ ction , and yet , you have to guess my mind .
cal@@ ming the audience down ; i &apos;m supposed to be whi@@ pping you into a fren@@ zy , and i , &quot; that &apos;s enough . sh . &quot;
and many , many things at google have come out of that , such as or@@ ku@@ t and also google news .
they said , obviously tried to dis@@ soci@@ ate themselves from drugs , but said , &quot; it re@@ minds me of one thing and that &apos;s the value of the brand has sta@@ yed consi@@ stent . &quot;
so far , our atmosphere has done , and our magnetic field has done pretty well prote@@ cting us from this .
that &apos;s exactly the same &#91; one &#93; you saw in the video actually .
now , at coun@@ t@@ less meetings at , you know , the port@@ land city coun@@ cil , or who knows where , they said , we need an architect -- can we get frank ge@@ hr@@ y ?
forget that . we move on .
if you haven &apos;t seen it , it &apos;s worth reading . he &apos;s a pian@@ ist himself , and he details his whole career of looking at and obser@@ ving incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peop@@ les &apos; lives in unusual situations .
do you really want to ele@@ ct a president whose genome suggests car@@ di@@ om@@ yo@@ pathy ?
in that interpretation , by bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy and admini@@ stration , and they do it beauti@@ fully , may i say .
so you send a comm@@ and out , you get sensor@@ y feedback back , and that transformation is gover@@ ned by the physics of your body and your sensor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us .
i know john &apos;s story very well because i &apos;m john .
and another piece for the art direc@@ tors &apos; club is &quot; an@@ na re@@ es &quot; ca@@ sting long sha@@ do@@ ws .
they don &apos;t want to feel like they need to take a sho@@ wer to get the moral gri@@ me off their bodies everyday when they come home from work .
it &apos;s trying to get a gras@@ p on you , on the fir@@ m@@ ware inside the human sk@@ ul@@ l , so that it can re@@ com@@ men@@ d what movie you might want to watch next -- which is a very , very difficult problem .
and what do we do ? we add some water .
now , these people making these pro@@ cla@@ ma@@ tions to me were not bad people .
maybe terrible over there , but not too bad there , etc . , etc .
i &apos;ve got nothing against people who take them short term , when they &apos;re going through something perfectly horri@@ ble .
&quot; give us the new , &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
it &apos;s a kind of invention of the museum that &apos;s supposed to bring a kind of co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ ve understanding to the public of a body of work .
we are not alone .
the re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers have kind of quas@@ hed this notion though .
thank you .
he &apos;s dem@@ and@@ ing to meet the architect . could you come down and meet him in tel a@@ vi@@ v ? &quot;
in the u.s. and spa@@ in , it was popular at the same time .
the same thing in the dar@@ k@@ room .
early journ@@ alists looked at these sp@@ ills , and they said , &quot; this is a fil@@ thy industry . &quot;
it &apos;s got this sort of so@@ ap oper@@ a-@@ like lifest@@ yle ; they have sex , they bur@@ row into your li@@ ver , they tun@@ nel into your blood cells ...

what do we do with dis@@ placed fellow earth@@ l@@ ings who no longer have a home on the planet ?
when i walked across afghanistan , i sta@@ yed with people like this .
for bank@@ ers , we &apos;d be living off the princi@@ p@@ al , not the interest .
third step is cognitive dis@@ son@@ ance .
but secon@@ dly , i bl@@ ame the queen because dic@@ tion@@ aries have really not changed .
now , we had to start somewhere , and so no@@ am and i decided to base our ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral , so to speak , on the simpl@@ est possible building block , which is something called n@@ and .
so we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember .
but he found 1@@ 40 com@@ ets without a telescop@@ e .
so i &apos;m really a basic scientist , not a clin@@ i@@ cian , but in the last year and a half i &apos;ve started to switch over , to use what we &apos;ve been learning about these patterns of activity to develop pro@@ s@@ thetic devices , and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this .
they &apos;ve got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level .
this is the one now at the computer history museum in california , and it calcul@@ ates ac@@ cur@@ ately . it actually works .
we need to take a really positive view .
and right now , that independent re@@ public of the supply chain is not being gover@@ ned in a way that would satis@@ fy us , that we can engage in eth@@ ical trade or eth@@ ical consumption .
so , i have more , you can always ask me for some more later .
up , don &apos;t move the wr@@ ist . over the heart , don &apos;t move the wr@@ ist .
at the end of the night , i stri@@ pped and let everyone draw on me .
will i not make enough money ?
so i &apos;m going to demon@@ strate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean .
and who &apos;s responsible ? designers .
and these are two proje@@ ctions from the world .
the w@@ right brothers , in the beginning of the last century , had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly .
but it did lead to new@@ ton disco@@ vering gravity .
if people like kit@@ ty j@@ ones -- right , a shu@@ t-@@ out -- a private music teacher and mom from cham@@ pagne , il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world , on how to teach kids how to play music .
so it provi@@ des certain areas for perception and ima@@ ge-@@ making .
and he sc@@ ans across the ocean , and he looks at the sky .
it is a structure for main@@ tain , for cent@@ u@@ ries , by generations , without any department , without any fund@@ ing , so the secret is &quot; &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , &quot; respect .
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?
and then he went on , and then he turned to me and said , &quot; you &apos;re an american .
for me , it &apos;s all about looking at the internet in an entirely new way to realize that there &apos;s so much more to it than just po@@ sting du@@ ck@@ -@@ face pictures of yourself online .
one in seven afri@@ cans is a nigeri@@ an , and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in nigeria . and when m@@ t@@ n came in , they wanted to sell the mobile service like i get in the united states or like people get here in the u.k. or in europe -- expensive mon@@ th@@ ly plans , you get a phone , you pay over@@ ages , you &apos;re killed with fe@@ es -- and their plan cr@@ as@@ hed and bur@@ ned .
son@@ y &apos;s got this vision back -- to get myself on track -- that when you stand in the che@@ ck@@ out line in the super@@ market , you &apos;re going to watch a new t@@ .@@ v@@ . chan@@ nel .
and the moment , and i mean the moment , the moment that hit me , i swe@@ ar to god , it was like wo@@ o ho@@ o ! you know -- something to believe in .
and , in fact , the equ@@ ations that make neurons into electrical gener@@ ators were discovered by two cambridge no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates .
and if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stam@@ p this was mol@@ ded from , it hel@@ pf@@ ully explains to you what sam@@ ple problem you can return to to find the for@@ mul@@ a .
but he says , &quot; we want a nu@@ clear@@ -@@ free world . &quot;
and explo@@ iting that energy , human popu@@ lations multi@@ pli@@ ed .
they think of them as the anno@@ ying , fru@@ str@@ ating ob@@ struc@@ tions , and then they rus@@ h off and do some blu@@ e-@@ sky thinking .
what it does is a very simple idea of taking -- 80 to 90 percent of the co2 produced in manhattan is building related -- we take , just like a commercial green@@ house , we take the co2 from the building -- co@@ 2-@@ en@@ rich@@ ed air -- we force it through the urban agriculture facili@@ ty , and then we res@@ upp@@ ly oxy@@ gen@@ -@@ en@@ rich@@ ed air .
and why on earth could that be so ?
so , you always find dinosaurs in deser@@ ts or b@@ ad@@ lands , areas that have very little plant growth and have flas@@ h f@@ loo@@ ds in the spring .
so if you &apos;re going to talk about jobs , then you have to talk about entreprene@@ urs .
how can a family get dy@@ s@@ func@@ tional ?
our idea of mo@@ bility is trying to make the connections between all the systems .
he looks , it &apos;s a dog , he dro@@ ps to his k@@ ne@@ es .
when you &apos;re tou@@ ching your ne@@ ck , you &apos;re really prote@@ cting yourself .
we fly these air@@ planes at 5,000 feet in the air .
we &apos;ve got 800 people in te@@ hr@@ an who watch ted@@ talks .
and inspired by what i learned from na@@ than@@ iel , i started an organization on sk@@ id row of musi@@ cians called street sym@@ ph@@ ony , bringing the light of music into the very dar@@ k@@ est places , per@@ forming for the hom@@ eless and ment@@ ally ill at shel@@ ters and clin@@ ics on sk@@ id row , per@@ forming for com@@ bat veter@@ ans with post-@@ trau@@ matic stress dis@@ order , and for the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated and those lab@@ el@@ ed as crimin@@ ally in@@ san@@ e .
it &apos;s one of the characteri@@ stics of a leader that he not dou@@ bt for one moment the capacity of the people he &apos;s leading to realize whatever he &apos;s dre@@ aming .
so their jud@@ g@@ ments of the case when everything was fine re@@ main the same . they say she deser@@ ves no bl@@ ame .
now let &apos;s ask ourselves , what could such arti@@ facts say about us to people 4@@ ,000 years into the future ?
what you really want is not a sequ@@ enti@@ al , not par@@ alle@@ l development .
when i vis@@ ited them a few years ago , what really impres@@ sed me was their will@@ ing@@ ness to prototyp@@ e their ideas very early .
and i &apos;ve been ri@@ ding with these kids once a week , every tu@@ es@@ day , rain or sh@@ ine , for the last four years and by now , they &apos;ve become a very big part of my life .
and in that area we started growing some ac@@ ac@@ ia trees that you just saw before .
you know , take a look at his face .
ar@@ che@@ ologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won &apos;t know about defen@@ sive medicine and stuff , but they &apos;ll see all these lab@@ els , &quot; cont@@ ents are extremely hot . &quot;
and when i was resear@@ ching pe@@ ar@@ l diver@@ s , i found the world of fre@@ e-@@ di@@ ving .
and i want to invi@@ te you now to come along on my journey of re@@ education and discovery .
and just to give you one instance of this : food .
he said , &quot; my job is to prove dr. ste@@ wart wrong . &quot;
and there are a lot of simil@@ ari@@ ties between the internet and the electric industry .
and most kids do .
and he said that the explosion was so l@@ oud and the light was so inten@@ se , that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes .
steve jobs had given us some laptops ; we were in sen@@ egal .
if you don &apos;t att@@ end to something , you can &apos;t be aware of it .
we bor@@ ro@@ wed it . video con@@ fer@@ en@@ cing . the personal computer itself .
but the men had a better idea .
eyes up here .
but actually , they were impres@@ sed by my words .
well , yeah .
in fact , even if producing co2 was good for the environment , given that we &apos;re going to run out of hydro@@ carb@@ ons , we need to find some sustainable means of operating .
some libr@@ ari@@ ans es@@ cape , and over the course of days and weeks , they di@@ p the st@@ ones into the ti@@ gr@@ is and su@@ ck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization .
m@@ all@@ ory &apos;s argument that leaving the house , embar@@ king on these grand ad@@ vent@@ ures is jo@@ y@@ ful and fun , however , doesn &apos;t t@@ ally that ne@@ at@@ ly with my own experience .
who has an answer for char@@ lie ?
this j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , for example , has a spec@@ tac@@ ular bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ cent display .
this is indeed the true heart of the planet .
so the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross heli@@ cal skelet@@ ons cut so that you &apos;re looking at the surface of the wall .
60 to 80 percent of the work@@ force in china is women in the co@@ ast@@ al part of the country , whereas in india , it &apos;s all men .
that really , the mix@@ ing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjo@@ yed a career doing that .
rb : no , i think if you &apos;re bringing up kids , you just want to s@@ mother them with love and pra@@ ise and enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m .
and they could use those for practice ball@@ s .
and i fra@@ med it with color so you would not conf@@ use it with adverti@@ sing .
you had to learn about a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics .
there you go . that &apos;s connection .
just to get rid of this go@@ d@@ less person out there that syl@@ via brow@@ ne talks about all the time ?
many of you know that he was dea@@ f , or near pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly dea@@ f , when he wrote that .
and so a year ago , i showed this off at a computer show called e@@ 3 .
i was@@ hed my face with this this morning in prepar@@ ation for this .
i think it &apos;s people &apos;s curi@@ osity that motiv@@ ates them to come into the projects .
fort@@ y-@@ five years after gei@@ ger , health leads has to rein@@ vent the pres@@ cri@@ ption for basic resources .
so that &apos;s all i &apos;m going to say about that .
i didn &apos;t use it as a special effect , but as a partner on stage .
and so we were com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed to design a bridge that would open .
we haven &apos;t yet understood that we &apos;re going at a much faster p@@ ace than the planet can susta@@ in .
people i inter@@ ac@@ ted with daily , worked with , was friends with , family members that i had known a long time , had never shared with me their own stories .
i talk to him for hours .
we tried to make it more difficult .
and we were down to eating one me@@ al a day , running from place to place , but wher@@ ever we could help we did .
here &apos;s an individual hair with a little spli@@ t end there .
and it &apos;s not just technology that we &apos;re putting into animals .
only two percent , only two percent of tri@@ bes get to stage five .
well , as it turns out , there is an algorith@@ m for love .
but this is my wee@@ k@@ ly pay@@ check for kids ; that &apos;s our green gra@@ ff@@ iti .
so we use this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion to boun@@ ce stuff around the internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ ils , pass it through legal j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions like swe@@ den and bel@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those legal prote@@ ctions .
this story just kee@@ ps playing over and over and over again in our country &apos;s history .
and here &apos;s a map of that condition , showing the cont@@ amin@@ ants in yellow and green , exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated by this new flow of stor@@ m-@@ sur@@ ge and se@@ a-@@ level rise .
and to get the government per@@ mis@@ sions , you read in the paper , you think it &apos;s easy to get into cu@@ ba everyday ?
and this is a sta@@ tic culture .
not many people check bo@@ xes .
and it has not stopped its evolutionary path .
we all are creative people .
suddenly the voice didn &apos;t seem quite so ben@@ ig@@ n anymore , and when she insi@@ sted that i se@@ ek medical attention , i du@@ ly comp@@ lied , and which pro@@ ved to be mistake number two .
they &apos;ll do stuff you and i can &apos;t do .
and we &apos;re hop@@ ing to some ex@@ tent history will say we were right .
but meetings also pro@@ create .
and here it is with the abstra@@ ct surro@@ unding .
i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , belie@@ ving in all this non@@ sense over all these years .
so this neu@@ tr@@ ality policy is really important for us , because it em@@ power@@ s a community that is very diver@@ se to come together and actually get some work done .
the ocean has an amazing ability to re@@ cover , if we &apos;ll just leave it alone .

so , the fashi@@ oni@@ st@@ as don &apos;t really like me because it doesn &apos;t matter if k@@ ate mo@@ ss is wearing it or if i &apos;m wearing it , it looks the same .
why aren &apos;t you ?
this is the 21@@ st-@@ century biology that you &apos;ve been waiting for , and we have the chance to take that and turn it into something which will , in fact , kno@@ ck out disease . that &apos;s my goal .
when they go out , they travel in these curious ar@@ mor@@ ed vehi@@ cles with these some@@ what thre@@ at@@ ening security teams who ready 24 hours in ad@@ v@@ ance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour .
they moved on to some other situation .
here &apos;s a st@@ at worth knowing : in the u@@ k , 6@@ 3 % of men who finish shor@@ t-@@ term prison sent@@ ences are back inside within a year for another crime . helping them stay outside invol@@ ves job training , clas@@ ses , therapy . and it would pay off hand@@ som@@ ely -- but the government can &apos;t find the fun@@ ds . to@@ by ec@@ cles shares an imag@@ in@@ ative idea for how to change that : the social impact bon@@ d . it &apos;s an unusual bon@@ d that helps fund initi@@ a@@ tives with a social goal through private money -- with the government paying back the inv@@ e@@ stors if the initi@@ a@@ tives work .
they are the poor@@ est of the poor .
i read the trials on this . they were all positive . they were all well-@@ condu@@ cted .
and with that in mind , i &apos;d like to say a few words about traditional college gra@@ ding .
so , what is to be done ?
pe@@ el@@ ing in the animal . pe@@ el@@ ing in the me@@ cho@@ -@@ ge@@ ck@@ o -- that allows them clim@@ b autonom@@ ously . can go on the flat surface , transition to a wall , and then go onto a cei@@ ling .
not that i &apos;m not afraid now , but i &apos;ve learned to pre@@ tend .
it &apos;s also obje@@ c@@ tion@@ able on a second ground .
there is a zone there , around gu@@ ant@@ an@@ am@@ o bay , where a treat@@ y gives the united states admini@@ stra@@ tive responsibility for a piece of land that &apos;s about twice the size of manhattan .
there &apos;s people getting dr@@ un@@ k building le@@ go , and you &apos;ve got to finish the thing before you pu@@ ke .
we really think it &apos;s a phenomen@@ al driver of things , to force us to do things differently , and we look forward to being able to actually , working with so many part@@ ners around the world , to be able to reach that goal .
and that &apos;s when you started to get seven different kinds of v@@ ine@@ gar , and 14 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d , and 7@@ 1 different kinds of o@@ live oil -- and then eventually even ra@@ g@@ u hi@@ red howard , and howard did the ex@@ act same thing for ra@@ g@@ u that he did for pre@@ go .
i call it my z@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ n. clu@@ ster .
just as we can &apos;t predict what one molecule in a gas will do -- it &apos;s hop@@ eless to predict a single molecule -- yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas , using ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics , very ac@@ cur@@ ately .
you &apos;re much too young to help .
if you want to take on the identity of shar@@ on bo@@ one , one american female marketing ex@@ ecu@@ tive from ho@@ bo@@ ken , new jer@@ sey . it &apos;s a full do@@ ssi@@ er on everything you would need to know about shar@@ on bo@@ one .
every par@@ ent i know , myself inclu@@ ded , feels like we &apos;re constantly playing defen@@ se .
i started writing fi@@ ction at the age of eight .
actually , i &apos;m going to pass over this .
but actually i did .
i would like to bring co@@ st@@ a on , if he &apos;s here , to show you the only one of its kind in the world .
now , what le@@ op@@ ard se@@ als do mostly is , they eat penguins .
you can &apos;t pick individual she@@ ep , but you can buy a single pla@@ te block of stam@@ ps as a com@@ modi@@ ty .
so we &apos;ve been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activ@@ ate this fo@@ x@@ o cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will del@@ ay aging and a@@ ge-@@ related diseases .
it &apos;s a vie@@ wing place for people , not machin@@ ery .
let &apos;s study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
in 197@@ 9 , i wit@@ n@@ essed my first military cou@@ p .
because we can completely control their experience , and see how that al@@ ters the architecture of their brain .
it &apos;s creating electrical patterns .
that is an un@@ known part of them .
one of those small is@@ lands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of so@@ vi@@ et biological weapons testing .
so when we did , we found some very surprising things .
in other words , when we communicate from the outside in , yes , people can understand vast amo@@ unts of complicated information like fe@@ atures and benefits and facts and fig@@ ures .
i was asked to do a hospital for schizophren@@ ic ad@@ oles@@ cents at y@@ ale .
not six months later , in ju@@ ly 200@@ 2 , ethi@@ op@@ ia announ@@ ced a major food crisis , to the same propor@@ tions as 198@@ 4 : 14 million people at risk of star@@ vation .
and perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with y chromo@@ som@@ es -- decided they would want to sequence it .
in the same year that i vis@@ ited this factory , i went to pakistan , where people in 2008 were going hun@@ gry as a result of a squ@@ ee@@ ze on global food supp@@ lies .
i &apos;ve intervie@@ wed more than a thousand people in the past .
if anybody here is a fan of the original &quot; star tre@@ k , &quot; they ran across an alien ship that had an i@@ on drive , and spo@@ ck said , &quot; they &apos;re very techni@@ cally sophisti@@ cated .
no , it &apos;s a hor@@ m@@ one called oxyto@@ cin .
and yet the politi@@ ci@@ zation of never again , the oper@@ a@@ tion@@ alization of never again , had never occur@@ red in the 20th century .
the phar@@ a@@ oh got -- i swe@@ ar to god .
bra@@ d pit@@ t : well , i heard mom@@ ma and ti@@ zz@@ y wh@@ is@@ per , and they said i was gon@@ na die soon , but ... maybe not .
and if you really want to see the difference , you look at the toi@@ let over here .
perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear , and because they practice such art all day long , people hon@@ est@@ ly get a little ti@@ red around kids .
you can plu@@ g in and experience what it &apos;s like to be someone else .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
what we &apos;ve done as sp@@ am@@ mers is tried to h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ ze everyone into buying our idea , h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ ze everyone into don@@ ating to our cause , h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ ze everyone into vot@@ ing for our can@@ di@@ date .
so i &apos;m really sorry . but when you use a part of something -- like the dic@@ tion@@ ary is a part of the language , or a fla@@ g stands for the united states , it &apos;s a symbol of the country -- then you &apos;re using it sy@@ ne@@ c@@ do@@ ch@@ ically .
i &apos;m thinking of an older version of himself .
now that &apos;s an incredible phenomen@@ a , because it &apos;s a star that si@@ ts there .
we failed .
and i quite simply think that this is not something that should be decided just in canada .
look into those eyes . i &apos;m not able to focus those eyes .
now the tar@@ a@@ hum@@ ar@@ a are remarkable for three things .
do you want to go for a wee@@ k@@ end to ro@@ me ?
consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : what to do about them ?
a market@@ place was hit by a mor@@ t@@ ar sh@@ ell that killed several members of a single family .
or his restaurant , po@@ d , in phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania .
and perhaps the best place to start is with my late father .
let &apos;s take a look .
because that is what is so wonderful about ted .
it &apos;s perfectly possible to create these social pres@@ sur@@ es which lead to more eg@@ al@@ it@@ arian societies .
i believe they &apos;ve heard your talk .
once again , they &apos;re smart enough , these cep@@ hal@@ o@@ po@@ ds ; they know not to hurt each other .
and this brings me to my favorite story from the tre@@ as@@ ure res@@ cu@@ e .
i mean you have become , whether you can gi@@ g@@ gle at it because it &apos;s a funny ... you know , it &apos;s a strange thought , but your building is an ic@@ on -- you can draw a little picture of that building , it can be used in ads -- and you &apos;ve had not rock star status , but cele@@ bri@@ ty status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life .
you understand the full scop@@ e of the project .
because the people who can actually solve them actually are too powerful and too pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed with something they think of as &quot; strategy &quot; to actually solve them .
s@@ k : it &apos;s two fif@@ th grade clas@@ ses and two se@@ vent@@ h grade clas@@ ses .
no problem . yeah , you know . &quot;
it requires hundreds of steps , and it takes a long , long time .
and the results can be pretty funny .
and again , this is a pretty big mar@@ ch to take here .
so we need to recognize those hot spo@@ ts and do our best to protect them .
she &apos;s a technology leader and in@@ struc@@ tional leader .
after two weeks of working in that village , it was time to go back .
when was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the head@@ line was , &quot; boy dies of as@@ th@@ ma ? &quot;
i click on him , and i really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice , in fact .
and i stood there on the edge of the la@@ ke , and i looked up at mt . ever@@ est -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and i said to myself , just do this slowly .
co : my car is in my living room .
you &apos;ve got a reas@@ on@@ able obje@@ ction to it ?
so while eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans were known for their sing@@ le-@@ dig@@ it tur@@ n@@ out in elec@@ tions before the revolution , the last ele@@ ction had around 70 percent vot@@ er tur@@ n@@ out -- men and women .
the second time , maybe it &apos;s after the fourth to@@ ss .
and i want to tell you how this gun can help .
at the time that this was going on , the last thing on my mind was &quot; art project . &quot;
they took some of this same pi@@ ck@@ led th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine dna and they spli@@ ced it into a mouse genome , but they put a tag on it so that anything that this th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine dna produced would appear blu@@ e-@@ green in the mouse baby .
and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways , because it couldn &apos;t not work .
on a given day , studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
in africa , small farmers bear the br@@ unt of this risk .
they showed p@@ uss o@@ o@@ zing out from between their teeth .
you know , ever since man had any notion that some of his other people , his colleagues , could be different , could be strange , could be sever@@ ely depres@@ sed or what we now recognize as schizophren@@ ia , he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spi@@ ri@@ ts getting into the body .
climate change den@@ i@@ ers like to use this fact to conf@@ use and trick the public by saying , &quot; look , the temperature causes co2 to change , not vice ver@@ sa . &quot;
so i &apos;ll just show you an instance -- so when people enter the room , it activ@@ ates this object .
it &apos;s now in virg@@ ini@@ a and london . and we built software that &apos;ll link func@@ tional magnetic res@@ on@@ ance ima@@ ging devices up over the internet . i guess we &apos;ve done up to six machines at a time , but let &apos;s just focus on two .
now who is rational ?
as i mentioned last year , i grew up with no religion at all .
free@@ man dy@@ son : let &apos;s look for life in the ou@@ ter solar system
it &apos;s your major ar@@ tery , and it was se@@ vered , so my blood was gur@@ gling out of my mouth .
and just as he &apos;s writing , you know , bacteria that will be smaller , he &apos;s writing genom@@ es that will work , we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .
any time there is a program that &apos;s better at survi@@ ving in this world , due to whatever mu@@ tation it has ac@@ qui@@ red , it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extin@@ ction .
and so we looked into this a little more carefully , and i &apos;m going to show you data now .
it &apos;s cop@@ per and gal@@ v@@ ani@@ ze .
each one of those is a year .
so i took the 600 sum@@ mar@@ ies that i had , put them into nine groups according to the rat@@ ings that the talks had origin@@ ally received on ted@@ .com and asked people to do sum@@ mar@@ ies of those .
but mostly we all just sit there forever , waiting .
every single year : fewer electri@@ cians , fewer car@@ pen@@ ters , fewer pl@@ um@@ bers , fewer wel@@ ders , fewer pi@@ pe@@ fit@@ ters , fewer ste@@ am@@ fit@@ ters .
and she said that it &apos;s a rather bor@@ ing movie .
and this is all relative to un@@ re@@ stra@@ ined -- the bigger the bar , the better . okay .
we had a press conference , we announ@@ ced our in@@ tent to do one zer@@ o-@@ g par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a , give him 25 seconds of zer@@ o-@@ g .
and we hypo@@ thes@@ ize based on the ti@@ ck@@ ling study that when one child hits another , they generate the movement comm@@ and .
and the way we deal with that is we dis@@ place them -- we put them into a golden world , an imag@@ ined world , an age of hero@@ es , the world to come .
there &apos;s a little le@@ dge inside , so the te@@ a is sitting there and the water is fil@@ ling it up like that .
and ma@@ d@@ ha@@ v said , &quot; why do we have to do it that way ?
and this was a company where i built par@@ ab@@ ol@@ as , i took metal shop , and i remember walking into metal shop building par@@ ab@@ ol@@ as and stir@@ ling eng@@ ines .
my doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent , and it was killing me .
we care what happens in &quot; apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se now . &quot;
and this gets me back to my research .
i got 200 in the first two weeks .
and they had l@@ ung@@ s .
but even the small meaning made a difference .
and if we have these predic@@ table repe@@ at@@ able mistakes in vision , which we &apos;re so good at , what &apos;s the chance that we don &apos;t make even more mistakes in something we &apos;re not as good at -- for example , financial decision making : something we don &apos;t have an evolutionary reason to do , we don &apos;t have a speci@@ alized part of the brain , and we don &apos;t do that many hours of the day .
maybe i do need a definition of life in order to make that kind of distin@@ ction .
the relationship between the la@@ p and its ow@@ ner is direct and inti@@ mate .
he got his paper back expe@@ cting a ne@@ ar-@@ perfect sc@@ ore , and couldn &apos;t believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero .
look at that lo@@ vely , black shark sli@@ me .
and i think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this .
and this is also again showing us what we can do .
while , at the same time , the actual number of transplan@@ ts has rema@@ ined almost entirely flat .
i jo@@ ined ford after college , after some sou@@ l se@@ arch@@ ing whether or not this is really the right thing to do .
that &apos;s where those big pe@@ a@@ ks are over to the left .
we train pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical techni@@ cians for the pharma@@ cy industry , we train medical techni@@ cians for the medical industry , and we train chemical techni@@ cians for companies like ba@@ yer and cal@@ g@@ on carbon and fis@@ her scientific and ex@@ x@@ on .
what you &apos;re seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest ne@@ ar@@ by here , of a female king co@@ br@@ a making her nest .
there &apos;s 10,000 neurons here .
does she not learn from them ? and so on .
&quot; you &apos;ve got more sharks and you &apos;ve got ti@@ gers . &quot;
in the last 50 years , the inci@@ dence of den@@ gue has grown thir@@ ty@@ fold .
we &apos;re still not re@@ con@@ struc@@ ting them well enough .
and my big failure ? i came out with an entire record al@@ bu@@ m and hopefully a whole bunch of record al@@ bu@@ ms in sac@@ d form@@ at -- this remarkable new form@@ at -- and i market@@ ed it straight to people with 20@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar stere@@ os .
amazing . thank you .
gor@@ don brown : i think it is about global citi@@ zen@@ ship . it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing our responsi@@ bilities to others .
the stories were so comp@@ elling that i decided to write a book about them .
and you can buy ste@@ pp@@ er mot@@ ors that pretty much never wear out because they have no br@@ us@@ hes , for a dollar .
what &apos;s going on in nigeria ? a couple of things .
as far as we know , evidence to discover the most fundamental tru@@ ths of all the sci@@ ences is here just for the taking on our planet .
and d@@ b will probably roll toward you .
but right now , you pretty much have to take silicon , put it in an o@@ ven at 1@@ 600 degrees fahr@@ enheit for 17 hours , to make the cells .
so if you &apos;re thinking about sending your kid to tin@@ ker@@ ing school , they do come back bru@@ is@@ ed , sc@@ ra@@ ped and b@@ loo@@ dy .
it &apos;s the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been ele@@ cted head of student government at any university .
so let &apos;s talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and 13 .
and this is what we &apos;re doing .
what , to power -- for ligh@@ ting and stuff ?
they &apos;re going to talk to the machine .
the house is 194@@ 9 .
it cannot hi@@ de behind the black hole .
for every community in the united states , you could have your own person@@ alized map of that .
it &apos;s you ; you &apos;re broken .
for various reasons , she was later char@@ ged with mur@@ der .
so he designed all these series of ac@@ cess@@ ories .
or , as ni@@ ke &apos;s head of marketing says , &quot; we &apos;re not in the business of keeping media companies alive .
it &apos;s da@@ un@@ ting .
and i &apos;ll just say two things about this .
and that may not sound very intui@@ tive , but let me fli@@ p over to something else you know about , and that &apos;s computers .
okay , all right . let &apos;s -- i suppose we &apos;d better ...
it is actually a business vent@@ ure .
in fact , this dark matter domin@@ ates the gravi@@ ta@@ tional effects in the universe on a large scale , and i &apos;ll be telling you about the evidence for that .
so i started asking myself , &quot; why haven &apos;t we been able to do better ? &quot;
we have tried everything , vie@@ wed everything , bought everything .
so we went to talk to the mini@@ stry of justice , and we said to the mini@@ stry of justice , what &apos;s it worth to you if fewer of these guys re-@@ off@@ end ?
pa@@ m war@@ hur@@ st : how we can eat our landscap@@ es
some of you would eat it only if it &apos;s a str@@ angel@@ y color@@ ed piece of to@@ f@@ u .
if you stand and st@@ are out of the window on your own with a ci@@ gar@@ ette , you &apos;re a fu@@ cking philosop@@ her .
something else you see that you talk about -- americans don &apos;t talk about this , but you do .
so we &apos;re really enter@@ ing the era of we@@ ar@@ able robo@@ tics actually .
and if you take a look at the head@@ line of stage five , which is &quot; life is great , &quot; this may seem a little in@@ con@@ gr@@ u@@ ous .
an amazing record of the col@@ oni@@ zation of the sahar@@ a 5,000 years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back . so , really exciting .
they had all sorts of different data forma@@ ts , all sorts , all kinds of docum@@ entation systems .
the digital mammo@@ gra@@ m was read as normal and shows lots of den@@ se tissue , but the m@@ bi shows an area of inten@@ se up@@ take , which cor@@ related with a two-@@ centi@@ meter tumor .
the world is changing with really remarkable speed .
you have to think about things like pause points .
but he &apos;s an absolute geni@@ us when it comes to design .
ph@@ .@@ d. &apos; s just flo@@ ck into this little room , and they &apos;re just fir@@ ing these questions at me , and by the end , i kind of felt like i was in a clo@@ wn car .
in this case it &apos;s mi@@ es van der ro@@ he &apos;s less is more .
after all , children &apos;s books are manu@@ als on par@@ enting , so you better give them children &apos;s books that teach them perspe@@ c@@ tives .
and then this is a film , on the lower left , that charles and ray made .
beautiful words about the power of science and exploration .
now this is not a problem of resources ; this is a problem of in@@ centi@@ ves .
and here is an image of a page ima@@ ged in 14 different wa@@ ve@@ b@@ ands of light .
in this short talk , psych@@ ologist dan ari@@ ely tells two personal stories that explore scientific conflict of interest : how the pur@@ suit of knowledge and insi@@ ght can be affected , consci@@ ously or not , by shor@@ t@@ si@@ gh@@ ted personal goals . when we &apos;re thinking about the big questions , he re@@ minds us , let &apos;s be aware of our all@@ -@@ to@@ o-@@ human brains .
like po@@ ll@@ s . you know , it &apos;s always curious to me that in public opini@@ on po@@ ll@@ s the percentage of americans who don &apos;t know the answer to any given question is always two percent .
i say there are two things .
an indian film star hu@@ g@@ ging a paki@@ stan@@ i cri@@ ck@@ e@@ ter because they &apos;d won in kol@@ kat@@ a .
the phot@@ ore@@ cep@@ tor cells are shown here at the top , and then the signals that are dete@@ cted by the phot@@ ore@@ cep@@ tors are trans@@ formed by various compu@@ tations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom , the gan@@ gli@@ on cells , rela@@ y the information to the brain , where we see that as perception .
it &apos;s essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff , with the things in our lives .
me sh@@ y@@ ly , ob@@ liqu@@ ely , trying not to be fur@@ tive .
nothing . they don &apos;t talk about us . they don &apos;t talk about the coal .
believe me , there &apos;s a whole lot easier ways to make money .
free@@ flying is more the three-@@ dimensional sky@@ di@@ ving .
and on this higher level he becomes lo@@ ving and for@@ giving .
but there &apos;s a unity of some sort that &apos;s starting to emer@@ ge .
so one of the pi@@ one@@ ers , for example , is dr. anth@@ ony at@@ ala , and he has been working on la@@ y@@ ering cells to create body parts -- bla@@ d@@ ders , val@@ ves , kid@@ ne@@ ys .
this is called syn@@ chro@@ tr@@ on radiation , and it &apos;s normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing .
you can see , she can move around .
it &apos;s real . it &apos;s happening .
however cru@@ el , however ru@@ th@@ less you can think this is it &apos;s a great design , and it is miles away from the fan@@ cy fur@@ ni@@ ture , but still , it &apos;s part of my same field of passion .
that &apos;s shown down here .
and you can just look at the head@@ lines .
but what g@@ ali@@ le@@ o saw was a ro@@ cky , bar@@ ren world , which he expres@@ sed through his water@@ color painting .
but only when we saw the tiny baby bab@@ o@@ on cl@@ inging to the mother &apos;s fu@@ r did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with le@@ ga@@ de@@ ma .
jun@@ e willi@@ am@@ son and i have been resear@@ ching this top@@ ic for over a decade , and we &apos;ve found over 80 vari@@ ed projects .
but that &apos;s the moment she &apos;s sur@@ gi@@ cally re@@ moving her@@ self from that .
sol@@ ly grew up ten@@ ding to his father &apos;s c@@ attle .
he said , &quot; listen , we &apos;re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree ?
so here &apos;s a compar@@ ison of several of these new v@@ acc@@ ine technologies .
and we ended up with something far more elegan@@ t than we could have imag@@ ined , even though this is essentially the same solution that a fru@@ strated kid uses when he can &apos;t draw hands , just hi@@ ding them in the po@@ ckets .
well , it &apos;s the relative importance .
it &apos;s from a gen@@ us called pa@@ ch@@ y@@ som@@ a .
i &apos;ve been playing ted for nearly a decade , and i &apos;ve very r@@ ar@@ ely played any new songs of my own .
this here is a bu@@ g in my genome that i have strug@@ gl@@ ed with for a long , long time .
that &apos;s the reason i &apos;m using this po@@ dium and using these notes .
and here &apos;s the robot operating at 10 times the speed of the human .
crazy , yes ?
virtu@@ ally everybody that got killed got killed from in@@ hal@@ ing the gas .
you view the bon@@ d in the tri@@ angle .
i know these are tough , and you may have a hard time getting your hand b@@ ent around it , but this is actually critical .

he sle@@ pt over at my house once , and he left his pil@@ low .
now , there are different kinds of di@@ stra@@ ctions , but there aren &apos;t the really bad kinds of di@@ stra@@ ctions that i &apos;ll talk about in just a minute .
the cen@@ su@@ s actually tried to look back in time , using every source of information they could get their hands on .
so , that answers that sort of first question i was talking about .
to say ah@@ h , if this happens then we are going to have a pan@@ de@@ mic ?
this , for me , is a chance to explore the limit@@ s -- really push the limit@@ s of my own potential , see how far they stre@@ tch .
and if we look at what we start with , a quar@@ ter of a new@@ ton there , a number of turns , perfect would be that red line .
we think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem -- we can un@@ do and un@@ friend and un@@ follow .
the capacity to create , as this mouse has been gene@@ tically modi@@ fied , something which goes three times faster , la@@ sts for three times longer , we could produce , as this mouse can , to the age of our equivalent of 80 years , using about the same amount of food .
but the other side of the equ@@ ation is you &apos;ve got to come out of your ca@@ ve .
and then they found , in 18@@ 9@@ 8 , that they &apos;d put about five bul@@ lets in the bu@@ ll@@ se@@ ye in a minute .
there are hundreds of thousands of acc@@ essi@@ ble books in the united states , britain , canada , australia , etc . , but they can &apos;t be transpor@@ ted to the 60 countries in our world where english is the first and the second language .
this is an ant that stor@@ es its colleagues &apos; hon@@ ey in its ab@@ d@@ omen .
and the first of these is to take some comfort in its univer@@ s@@ ality .
and on the web , my real voice fin@@ ds expression .
now , what &apos;s interesting is the animals , then -- we said -- boun@@ ce along the ver@@ tical plane this way , and in our collabor@@ ations with pi@@ x@@ ar , in &quot; a bu@@ g &apos;s life , &quot; we discus@@ sed the bi@@ pe@@ d@@ al nature of the characters of the ants .
how do you know that something is good for us or bad for us ?
that begins my trans@@ lation process .
the same time we load the bat@@ ter@@ ies , we run the eng@@ ines , and when we get at the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um hei@@ ght , we arri@@ ve at the beginning of the night .
&quot; po@@ em@@ s . i have to write po@@ em@@ s .

we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they &apos;d been impro@@ ved , and very simple things turned out .
but for us , the rain is good .
it goes from sla@@ ve trade to over@@ -@@ consumption of sugar with some swe@@ et moments in between .
and i think a lot of scientists have this at@@ titude .
let me show you what it looks like .
we &apos;ve lost that cap@@ ability . we ab@@ and@@ oned it in &apos; 7@@ 2 .
if you look clo@@ sely , you &apos;ll notice a series of what are russi@@ an tele@@ phone numbers .
i just came back from speaking in bar@@ cel@@ on@@ a at the yp@@ o global conference , and everyone that i met over there who &apos;s an entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r strug@@ gl@@ ed with school .
i &apos;m actually really quite interested , and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on .
because i have to show you one of the other facili@@ ties .
and then i asked the usual question : &quot; is it a pri@@ ority ?
jen@@ ny reali@@ zes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth .
i want to point out one thing . this is -- you guys know what this is .
we want it to be bi@@ -@@ direc@@ tional .
so , a moment .
and you know , how on earth did i get to 17 and not know that ?
these are photos of the last survi@@ ving th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine , ben@@ jam@@ in , who was in the beau@@ mar@@ is zo@@ o in ho@@ bart .
i was swi@@ mming with this thing on .
and you know what it was ? sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are . &quot; and he rec@@ ited some to me .
but you don &apos;t feel them , because the we@@ ak force is cor@@ rec@@ tly named -- very short range and very we@@ ak , so they just fly through you .
because if you can &apos;t get it in nas@@ h@@ ville , you can travel to bir@@ m@@ ing@@ ham , two hours away , and you &apos;ll get it . if you can &apos;t get it in cle@@ vel@@ and , you can go to cin@@ cin@@ nat@@ i . we don &apos;t have that lux@@ ury , so we have to make it happen .
and if you don &apos;t , who are you going to be ?
so let me take you back how it &apos;s so incredibly different building bu@@ zz@@ car than it was building zi@@ p@@ car , because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that i have to be thinking about : the ow@@ ners who are going to provide the cars and the dri@@ vers who are going to r@@ ent them .
and i needed to find something histor@@ ically that would match that .
i want that to happen .
so let me give you one very easy problem , a second very easy problem and then a third , hard , problem .
but we have to control our numbers , because we can &apos;t really hold it together as a species .
and now 4@@ ,000 chur@@ ches have jo@@ ined the environmental movement .
you &apos;re actually seeing and hearing quant@@ um information flow .
you can look to these inno@@ v@@ ators to help us especially with things that require technologi@@ cal or scientific solution .
i liked the fine detail it gave my work , but i wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
the fact of the matter is there is a lot of con@@ fusion around what really helps us live longer better .
and i don &apos;t know about you , but i pre@@ fer to d@@ ine .
but we wanted to make the economic case , because if we could make the economic case , then the value of doing this would be completely comp@@ elling .
i bor@@ row my friends &apos; children , so take all this ad@@ vice with a grain of s@@ alt .
so if you really care about streng@@ th@@ ening families , you might want to talk to some liber@@ al groups who are working on pro@@ mot@@ ing edu@@ cational equ@@ ality , who are working on raising the minim@@ um wa@@ ge , who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being su@@ cked into the crimin@@ al justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives .
so when you &apos;re watching &quot; law and order , &quot; and the law@@ yers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house , right into the collect pon@@ d , 400 years ago .
and that &apos;s un@@ comfortable .
the kids should learn it .
and they said , &quot; oh , well maybe we could become part of your strate@@ gic plan . &quot;
i &apos;d like to do pretty much what i did the first time , which is to choose a ligh@@ t-@@ he@@ ar@@ ted theme .
when i knew i was going to come to speak to you , i thought , &quot; i got@@ ta call my mother . &quot;
so we abor@@ ted using motion capture .
as j@@ ared diam@@ ond and others have shown us , this is how civili@@ zations com@@ mit su@@ i@@ cide , by s@@ lam@@ ming their foot on the acceler@@ ator at the ex@@ act moment when they should be putting on the bra@@ kes .
okay , one more . baby eleph@@ ant .
he gets ti@@ ed up to the sho@@ ck appar@@ at@@ us in another room .
on a more personal note , this betra@@ y@@ al of our principles , our dec@@ ency , our hope , made it impossible for me to avoid the question , &quot; what will i say , years from now , when people ask , &apos; where were you ? &apos; &quot; as president of a leading liber@@ al arts college , famous for its innovative history , there were no exc@@ uses .
in contr@@ ast , i took a pla@@ te with six one-@@ dollar bil@@ ls , and i left those pl@@ ates in the same re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators .
so we can work with gene@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts who understand that .
this particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment -- the fact that bees have a very strong ol@@ factory sense , and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer -- bees can be trained by pa@@ v@@ lo@@ vi@@ an refle@@ x to dete@@ ct one type of cancer , and also preg@@ nan@@ cy .
and we don &apos;t have a birth@@ right to just use that up as fast as we are , i think .
all along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long , slow climate change , and that really changed in 19@@ 80 , in this ro@@ cky out@@ cro@@ p near gu@@ b@@ bi@@ o , where wal@@ ter al@@ v@@ are@@ z , trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white ro@@ cks , which held creatures of the cre@@ tac@@ e@@ ous period , and the p@@ ink ro@@ cks above , which held ter@@ ti@@ ary fossi@@ ls .
but in fact , women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and roman@@ ce and family life .
&quot; god bl@@ ess you . &quot;
so , you can already see the surprise .
this is literally the color@@ ed sequence of those ti@@ les .
now by rights , this is kind of like a c@@ lon@@ ing project , like what produced dol@@ ly , but it &apos;s actually very different , because dol@@ ly was live she@@ ep into live she@@ ep cells .
gor@@ ge@@ ous assi@@ stant in@@ struc@@ tor .
and i &apos;m thinking , no , this is not possible .
and think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cell@@ ular mechan@@ ics .
if you &apos;re in america and you don &apos;t know about this one , we do , because we make it our du@@ ty to find out what &apos;s appropriate technology for africa -- what &apos;s appropri@@ ately pri@@ ced , does the job , and we move on . an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia machine : multi-@@ par@@ am@@ e@@ ter monit@@ or , operating lights , su@@ ction .
that is so right and so cool .
you think i will miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of priv@@ acy ?
so you will cut 60 percent off of op@@ e@@ c with eight million tru@@ cks .
people hate number ten like they hate un@@ i , actually .
le@@ xi@@ co@@ graph@@ y is really more about material science .
however , you notice , since empty space gives off radiation , there &apos;s actually ther@@ mal flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations , and it cy@@ cles around all the different possible combin@@ ations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space .
you don &apos;t want to stop in the middle like col@@ eri@@ dge &apos;s ku@@ bl@@ a ka@@ hn .
their at@@ tor@@ ney : &quot; ah , yes . my company &apos;s having a re@@ organization on our end . &quot;
and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resili@@ ence over time , there &apos;s a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing .
wal@@ sing@@ ham : ma@@ je@@ sty . please , dig@@ ni@@ ty . mer@@ cy .
so here my friends gene and ga@@ il had not heard from me in about a year , and suddenly i was calling , saying &quot; i &apos;m in korea , and i &apos;ve met this extraordinary girl . &quot;
it &apos;s an impres@@ sive track record , and so we look back and we say , well , we didn &apos;t really exactly work this out theore@@ tically from the start , but when we look back , there are theore@@ tical mov@@ ements in science education .
don &apos;t put it all in the brain , but put some of the control in tun@@ ed feet , legs and even body .
these are live bul@@ lets .
and the goal is that the world be des@@ ir@@ able and sustainable when my kids reach my age -- and i think that &apos;s -- in other words , the next generation . i think that &apos;s a goal that we probably all share .
before i introdu@@ ce the person responsible for the worldwide telescop@@ e , i just want to leave you with this brief thought : when i ask people , &quot; how does the night sky make you feel ? &quot;
in this context i &apos;ll just show you a few .
i started life as a ban@@ ker .
let me first explain how re@@ zero actually kee@@ ps his balance .
and i &apos;m trying to tell stories only i can tell -- like this story .
fourth i live happ@@ ily because what else should i do ?
so today i &apos;m here to argue that this is not at all an es@@ ot@@ eric i@@ vor@@ y to@@ wer activity that we find at our universi@@ ties , but that bro@@ ad study across species , tissue types and organ systems can produce insi@@ ghts that have direct impli@@ cations for human health .
so we work in a whole sensor@@ y movement task sou@@ p of noise .
we can actually study lin@@ e-@@ of-@@ sight vel@@ o@@ cities of co@@ s@@ mic objects .
but here we have the version three , the re@@ motion k@@ nee , but if you look in here , you can see the noise dam@@ pen@@ er . it &apos;s quie@@ ter .
an as@@ pen needs fire and dry so@@ ils .
i mean , you &apos;re born with no teeth .
and now , when we mel@@ d this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to .
yellow is so-@@ so , and in green are the countries doing really well .
there are risk fac@@ tors associated with c@@ es@@ are@@ an se@@ ctions , some of those risk fac@@ tors may be due to mis@@ -@@ col@@ oni@@ zation when you car@@ ve a baby out of its mother rather than being deli@@ vered through the birth can@@ al .
and they said , &quot; these kids are mis@@ led . &quot;
you see the ne@@ ther@@ lands is kind of the biggest of the small group .
we get dr@@ ou@@ ghts , increas@@ ed deser@@ ti@@ fication , cr@@ as@@ hing food systems , water sc@@ ar@@ city , fam@@ ine , forced migra@@ tion , political inst@@ ability , war@@ f@@ are , crisis .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
so , this is interesting to me , but it l@@ ac@@ ked a certain human element .
o@@ .@@ k. , so , everyone has a computer .
and in fact , university admini@@ strat@@ ors are a little un@@ comfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universi@@ ties .
now this is a depen@@ dence too , but it &apos;s different and confli@@ cting from a depen@@ dence upon the people alone so long as the f@@ under@@ s are not the people .
mt : yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the od@@ ds .
almost a quar@@ ter , or appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely a quar@@ ter of the matter in the universe , is stuff that &apos;s invisible .
we have like 40 kids , ex@@ -@@ child soldiers mix@@ ed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
they are se@@ eping around the world .
it doesn &apos;t scale , it doesn &apos;t work glob@@ ally , and it sur@@ ely doesn &apos;t work virtu@@ ally .
u@@ h-@@ oh ... u@@ h-@@ oh !
i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry . come over and i &apos;ll do the whole lot of you . &quot;
and yes , by the way , it is fast food : it &apos;s slo@@ pp@@ y jo@@ es , it &apos;s bur@@ gers , it &apos;s wi@@ en@@ ers , it &apos;s pi@@ zz@@ as , it &apos;s all of that stuff .
&quot; what does it matter ? &quot; they said , &quot; a bul@@ let doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish between a musli@@ m and a chri@@ stian . &quot;
we now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the un@@ seen world -- things like deep sequen@@ cing , which allow us to do much more than just sk@@ im the surface and look at individual genom@@ es from a particular species , but to look at entire meta@@ genom@@ es , the communities of te@@ em@@ ing micro@@ organisms in , on and around us and to docum@@ ent all of the genetic information in these species .
tiny , little word , 3@@ 3 num@@ ber@@ ed defini@@ tions .
&#91; live music &#93; doesn &apos;t really change that much .
it was time to go under@@ cover again .
then we wanted to get rid of the bu@@ g generally .
i want to show you a picture of what ro@@ unds looked like when i was in training .
here &apos;s the ki@@ cker . i don &apos;t remember that .
she &apos;s been able to produce record economic growth and meaning@@ fully move many people out of poverty , specifically putting a meaning@@ ful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indi@@ gen@@ ce .
it &apos;s a wonderful , very cra@@ ft@@ -@@ ori@@ ented society .
and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a co@@ st-@@ effective way of making a structure to do this .
and so we &apos;re just eating , and her ja@@ w just dro@@ ps , and she goes , &quot; mom !
and here &apos;s this really sophisti@@ cated technology coming down the road , all these associated social , moral , eth@@ ical questions , and we scientists are just l@@ ous@@ y at expla@@ ining to the public just exactly what it is we &apos;re doing in those lab@@ s .
and this tem@@ po@@ ral map was something that energi@@ zes modern com@@ ics , but i was wondering if perhaps it also energi@@ zes other sorts of forms , and i found some in history .
and their far@@ ms are also large .
so i actually went to school in bel@@ fast , which was where all the action happened .
so during the course of the day , five different sm@@ ells are dis@@ per@@ sed throughout that environment .
it &apos;s about context .
it &apos;s the place where you become yourself .
i &apos;m now suppor@@ ting ste@@ wart &apos;s position , soft@@ ly , from a ris@@ k-@@ management stand@@ point , agre@@ eing that the risks of over@@ he@@ ating the planet out@@ wei@@ gh the risk of nuclear inci@@ dent , which certainly is possible and is a very real problem .
at 1@@ 30 , we start somewhere above 1@@ 30 , between building a bom@@ b , and making enough weapon@@ s-@@ grade fuel so that you could build a bom@@ b .
e : o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ ow@@ w@@ w .
we thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against .
and because of that fear , we tend to do one of two things : we go into den@@ ial : &quot; it &apos;s not me , it has nothing to do with me , it &apos;s never going to happen to me . &quot;
so here is trust from a general social survey of the fe@@ der@@ al government related to ine@@ quality .
now , these are not goals or des@@ ires , these are universal .
in red are the eye movement tra@@ ces .
of course , they &apos;re plan@@ ting trees . they &apos;re growing organic vege@@ tables .
let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running .
because i was , sort of , up@@ set about this lam@@ ani@@ te story and this crazy gold pla@@ te story , but the truth was , i hadn &apos;t really thought this through , so i back@@ pe@@ d@@ aled a little and i said , &quot; well , what exactly do you mean by ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ?
there is an economy of scale .
ah , u@@ h -- ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le said that nature ab@@ h@@ ors one .
and he moved away because it was his last fishing trip , and he knew that the dolph@@ ins sc@@ are fish .
and i call that their agenda .
this is an area today that has very few regu@@ lations and even fewer rules .
they said , &quot; well , jes@@ us , they already know this stuff . &quot;
i said , &quot; well what about your dreams ? &quot;
so , there were the teachers and then there were my friends , class@@ mates from everywhere , many of whom are still de@@ ar friends to this day .
so what we &apos;re going to see is some of the i@@ con@@ s of e@@ ames fur@@ ni@@ ture .
people going , &quot; a@@ wes@@ ome whe@@ els , du@@ de ! those are a@@ wes@@ ome !
yeah , maybe it doesn &apos;t sound that much different .
students : i will change my life .
can we stop this , and how ?
he would takes the fru@@ its of each week &apos;s reading and he would wea@@ ve these intri@@ cate ta@@ pe@@ stri@@ es of ancient and human@@ ist thought .
this is all on be@@ half of a cause other than one &apos;s own genetic fit@@ ness , of course .
there &apos;s no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be inje@@ ction mol@@ ded in china .
&quot; now , frank is this clear to you , d@@ j@@ ab@@ ran flu@@ c@@ tus ? &quot;
for a long time , i didn &apos;t believe that i could have a big ad@@ vent@@ ure .
but what i &apos;d like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on earth -- or one out of every seven -- wo@@ ke up and didn &apos;t even know how to fill this c@@ up .
and i knew i had to tell je@@ ff pur@@ cell , my at@@ tor@@ ney , that i needed to leave .
they have electricity , but the question is , how many have was@@ hing machines ?
we all know which side of these we &apos;d like to be on .
let &apos;s not h@@ yp@@ e the threat ; let &apos;s actually see it clearly .
we went from 14 percent to seven percent .
i mean , your grand@@ parents had these great big con@@ es , and then your parents had these od@@ d bo@@ xes that would squ@@ aw@@ k at od@@ d times during dinner , and now we have these little bu@@ ds that nobody sees .
i like to imagine schwarz@@ schil@@ d in the war in the tren@@ ches calcul@@ ating bal@@ li@@ stic tra@@ je@@ c@@ tor@@ ies for can@@ n@@ on fire , and then , in between , calcul@@ ating einstein &apos;s equ@@ ations -- as you do in the tren@@ ches .
spread the word .
and i follow this question , not wor@@ rying about &quot; is it music ? &quot; -- not wor@@ rying about the definition of the thing that i &apos;m making .
sus@@ an black@@ more : someone says no , very lou@@ dly , from over there .
and therefore it will become in@@ toler@@ able -- what compassion is , is where it will become in@@ toler@@ able for us , totally in@@ toler@@ able that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjo@@ ying the life of the mind or whatever it is , and there are people who are absolutely ri@@ dd@@ led with disease and they cannot have a bi@@ te of food and they have no place , or they &apos;re being bru@@ tali@@ zed by some terrible person and so forth .
i &apos;ll just say , ju@@ ly .
it has a lot of dis@@ advan@@ tages : each one of these steps is extremely expensive , it &apos;s poten@@ tially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be per@@ formed in anyone &apos;s back@@ y@@ ard , which is a problem .
we want to satis@@ fy our individual des@@ ires .
and you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data .
yet , when we take a step back , and look over the sp@@ an of history , at what we might call the pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um inter@@ val , it &apos;s a short period in history where we &apos;ve discovered this extraordinary material , and then based a whole way of life around it .
well , we &apos;ve had government information campaig@@ ns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home .
any person anywhere is capable of ris@@ ing to that highest point of at@@ tain@@ ment , only by the resol@@ ve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something .
how do you have people reali@@ zing that they have a vision problem ?
when you &apos;re fac@@ ed with bru@@ tality , whether it &apos;s a child facing a bul@@ ly on a play@@ ground or dom@@ esti@@ c violence -- or , on the streets of sy@@ ri@@ a today , facing tan@@ ks and sh@@ ra@@ p@@ nel , what &apos;s the most effective thing to do ?
now you pre@@ p@@ are for the inevi@@ table .
co@@ ke &apos;s been in africa since 19@@ 28 , but most of the time they couldn &apos;t reach the dist@@ ant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large tru@@ ck roll@@ ing down the street .
though when the do@@ d@@ gers ab@@ and@@ oned us to come to l@@ .@@ a. , i lost faith in baseball until i moved to boston and became an ir@@ rational red so@@ cks fan .
we are all now deeply , deeply , deeply inter@@ connected .
around that time i met an extraordinary human being , peter th@@ um , who inspired me with his actions .
h@@ ence , we need a stance of proble@@ m-@@ fix@@ ing , not just proble@@ m-@@ avo@@ i@@ dance .
terrible na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in , is that one .
common sense here , though , has not yet revol@@ ted in response to this response that the law has off@@ ered to these forms of creativity .
this one is a circle , and this is a square .
so , that clearly wasn &apos;t going to work .
as you can see , that &apos;s a pin@@ head .
starting with four basic questions , jon@@ a@@ than dr@@ or@@ i looks at the g@@ ap@@ s in our knowledge -- and specifically , what we don &apos;t about science that we might think we do .
s@@ b : sin@@ k , toi@@ let , yes , these are all me@@ mes , they &apos;re all me@@ mes , but they &apos;re sort of useful ones , and then there &apos;s this one .
but it felt like a boo@@ by prize .
in humans -- by the way , this is true for all ma@@ mm@@ als ; it &apos;s true for other ma@@ mm@@ als -- and in humans , it got a lot worse .
to conclu@@ de , i would actually like to say , you may think this is about rat@@ s , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
we had to beat the european mon@@ arch@@ y .
so , why is it , that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world , we need a more just world , why is it that we are not using the one language that has consi@@ st@@ ently showed us that we can break down barri@@ ers , that we can reach people ?
i &apos;m a no@@ ve@@ list , and i &apos;m interested in the self because the self and fi@@ ction have a lot in common .
and finally , once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet , how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the de@@ fau@@ lt rather than the ex@@ ception ?
so , we should put it in the san andre@@ as fau@@ lt line in san francisco , flo@@ od zone in am@@ ster@@ dam and in the middle east . right , so anyway ...
that &apos;s the first line of defen@@ se for the body .
so i thought , i probably have to take this one step further here and create sum@@ mar@@ ies of the sum@@ mar@@ ies -- and this is exactly what i did .
and the ne@@ ar@@ est star is 4@@ .@@ 2 light years away , which means its light takes 4@@ .@@ 2 years to get here .
if the ju@@ dge can &apos;t tell the machine apart from the human , the machine has passed the test .
the vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydro@@ gen .
if you bought them in vast bul@@ ks , you could get them at a little under 400 dollars .
lou@@ ise lea@@ key talked yesterday about how we &apos;re the only one in this bran@@ ch left .
resol@@ ution is something that is far more limited .
so , they moved the entire village , hu@@ t by hu@@ t .
so , there &apos;s a fairly simple solution to this .
but there are more important things that are already oc@@ curr@@ ing : em@@ br@@ yo scre@@ ening .
and you can actually see that the licen@@ se pla@@ te of the sam@@ ar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ rus .
i said , &quot; he passed away a long time ago .
the problem is , you get into the city and you want to go four blocks , it &apos;s nei@@ ther fun nor efficient nor productive .
if we invest in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face and we capit@@ alize on the very real streng@@ ths of older people , then ad@@ ded years of life can dra@@ matically improve quality of life at all ages .
everybody gets heard .
and every single one of these companies den@@ ies .
the do@@ t is visible whenever a cell fir@@ es an electrical impul@@ se .
and i turned to my mom and my dad to tell them that we needed to go home , and just at that moment , you came out of the student union building wearing the stu@@ pi@@ dest hat i have ever seen in my life . &quot;
in fact , in the united states , whatever you may think of juli@@ an as@@ san@@ ge , even people who are not necessarily big fan@@ s of his are very concerned about the way in which the united states government and some companies have hand@@ led wiki@@ lea@@ ks .
sometimes it &apos;s g@@ arb@@ age , but the press is s@@ no@@ wed .
i see what the status qu@@ o is ; i don &apos;t like it . &quot;
this is a pen , it &apos;s called an insu@@ lin pen , pr@@ el@@ o@@ aded .
you sla@@ m them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that colli@@ sion will go into de@@ br@@ is that flies off into these extra dimensions .
but these bad projects , which were absolutely dama@@ ging -- for the economy for many generations , for the environment , for thousands of families who had to be res@@ et@@ t@@ led -- they were suddenly put together by con@@ sor@@ ti@@ a of ban@@ ks , of supp@@ li@@ er agen@@ cies , of in@@ sur@@ ance agen@@ cies -- like in germany , her@@ mes , and so on -- and they came back very , very quickly , driven by an un@@ hol@@ y alli@@ ance between the powerful eli@@ tes in the countries there and the supp@@ li@@ ers from the north .
all these forces came together there , in prin@@ c@@ et@@ on .
even in places like sen@@ egal , beginning in the early 20th century , there were major break@@ through@@ s in public health , and life expec@@ tan@@ cy began to rise .
he jum@@ ps back and there , of course , is the future budd@@ ha ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya in a beautiful vision -- rain@@ bo@@ w lights , golden , je@@ wel@@ ed , a pl@@ as@@ ma body , an ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te my@@ stic vision -- that he sees .
we put a ton of virus up this guy &apos;s nose . so -- -- i mean , we wanted it to work . he really had a cold .
and i think that d@@ j@@ ab@@ ran flu@@ c@@ tus , that f@@ its that mode .
i &apos;m looking for a husband . right ?
the north american network oper@@ ators group , a group of people who , on a beautiful day outside , enter into a win@@ dow@@ less room , at their ter@@ min@@ als reading email and mes@@ sages in fix@@ ed propor@@ tion f@@ on@@ t , like this , and they talk about networks .
so let me give you a famous example , a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diff@@ u@@ sion of innovation .
&quot; learn as if you &apos;ll live forever . &quot;
kids do art .
so we &apos;re probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking .
and this lo@@ go !
and it &apos;s extra@@ ordin@@ arily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very b@@ ad@@ ly .
and so it was an in@@ tent to make this small piece of land -- it &apos;s 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an e@@ state by separ@@ ating these areas and making the living room and din@@ ing room into this pa@@ vili@@ on with a high space in it .
that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allo@@ wan@@ ce for certain levels of inevi@@ table waste .
and that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
anything that makes me think . anything that i don &apos;t understand , where i have to make the lea@@ p myself , in my own head , is going to stop the flow of the pres@@ entation .
so they let him go .
they have an aids problem . i asked -- the u.s. state department asked the government recently , what do you want to do ? and they gave them two problems .
if you see them side by side , there &apos;s yellow and brown .
now , there &apos;s one piece of good news i have that may save the world . okay .
no dou@@ bt , i was in@@ formed , the con@@ sent had been ob@@ tain@@ ed .
i want to show you my work so you know what i am doing and why i am here .
give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like .
in other words , it is theore@@ tically possible that before too long we will be biot@@ echn@@ ologi@@ cally capable of creating human beings that glo@@ w in the dark .
most of them actually want to do the right thing , but they have to know what that is , and it &apos;s got to work .
i just imag@@ ined it everywhere , &quot; which has happened .
and my pan@@ ic at not having a self that fit , and the con@@ fusion that came from my self being re@@ je@@ cted , created an@@ x@@ iety , sh@@ ame and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , which kind of defined me for a long time .
one of the most interesting re@@ vel@@ ations came not from an answer to a question , but from a simple gest@@ ure of hospit@@ ality .
and this is an amazing experience for me as well .
then , once they are done with the training , they come back a few days later and they are te@@ sted again on a similar type of mental ro@@ tation task . so this is work from a collea@@ gue in tor@@ onto . what they showed is that , ini@@ tially , you know , subje@@ cts per@@ form where they are expected to per@@ form given their age . after two weeks of training on action video games , they actually per@@ form better , and the impro@@ vement is still there five months after having done the training . that &apos;s really , really important .
i wanted to become a teacher .
but if it were your culture , think of how that might feel .
and the wonderful el@@ ation that we had when we finally comple@@ ted it .
now , one of the things i &apos;d like to explain &#91; about &#93; 50@@ x@@ 15 , which i think is really critical , is that it is not a char@@ ity .
that mission is to de@@ f@@ end the freedom of the family that he left at home .
it wasn &apos;t for me .
on this side , you &apos;ve got a number -- the average number of to@@ s@@ ses until head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ head .
well , there are a couple esti@@ mates of how much it would cost to create a network of prote@@ cted areas co@@ vering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fra@@ ction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fis@@ her@@ y that is collap@@ sing .
some of the work you saw today was per@@ formed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20@@ -@@ year time sp@@ an .
in fact , when we see the end of the line for a particular paradig@@ m , it creates research pressure to create the next paradig@@ m .
the security coun@@ cil does its business in exactly the same way today that it did x number of years ago , when i was there 10 years ago .
i think it has relev@@ ance to any problem between people anywhere .
so , very interesting par@@ all@@ els between the biological and the engineering worl@@ ds . and interest@@ ingly , this turns out -- the sto@@ ma@@ to@@ po@@ d sa@@ dd@@ le turns out to be the first described biological hyper@@ bo@@ lic par@@ ab@@ olo@@ id spring .
this equ@@ ation , though , allows you to calcu@@ late everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe .
she changed her name to vi@@ vi@@ an because she wanted to fit in here in america .
however , if we work in ei@@ ght-@@ dimensional charge space , then we can as@@ sign unique new char@@ ges to each partic@@ le .
and they get depres@@ sed and they get sad on their own .
stories like the magic por@@ ri@@ dge po@@ t , where you had a po@@ t where if you knew the magic words , this po@@ t would just make as much food as you liked , without you having to do any work , provi@@ ded you could remember the other magic word to stop it making por@@ ri@@ dge .
so at that point , if we can go back to the other computer , we were starting to think about how you integra@@ te the rest of the bio@@ mass of the planet into the internet , and we went to the best possible person i can think of , which is vin@@ t cer@@ f , who is one of the fo@@ under@@ s who gave us the internet . vin@@ t ?
i mean , look at the time it took to cross a continent in a con@@ est@@ og@@ a wa@@ g@@ on , then on a ra@@ il@@ road , then an airplane .
who are we to pre@@ tend that we know so little about human well-@@ being that we have to be non-@@ jud@@ g@@ mental about a practice like this ?
once again , the car@@ tes@@ ian kind of cros@@ s-@@ over .
and as i looked into his eyes , i realized that for the hundreds of letters i had written for political pris@@ on@@ ers , that i would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12@@ -year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
somehow he did .
there is so many things to do ; it &apos;s so fresh .
this picture is supposed to be me during training .
i mean , they can do like seven kilometers an hour and susta@@ in it .
it may seem ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but we have a really l@@ ous@@ y history of anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating things like this and actually being prepared for them .
the self was not const@@ ant .
and i said , &apos; why are you so stupid , can &apos;t you keep your things together for goo@@ dness &apos; sa@@ ke ? &apos; &quot; the way an el@@ der sister might speak to a yo@@ unger brother .
and i thought , &quot; how could it ? because i &apos;ve lost everything that i valu@@ ed , everything that i &apos;d worked towards .
right now , you have to decide what you &apos;re going to focus on .
and by the end of this my arm is sor@@ e , i &apos;ve got a call@@ us on my hand , let alone bob , whose re@@ ar end looks something more like this , like s@@ wis@@ s che@@ ese .
it &apos;s becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist el@@ se@@ where in the universe , and probably fairly close to us , is a fairly remote idea .
one example of how these guys actually are capable of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the pages of inter@@ po@@ l and search for wanted person@@ s .
but non@@ eth@@ eless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
someone came up to them and said , &quot; you &apos;re the cho@@ sen one .

if you put car@@ pe@@ ting in your house , it &apos;s about a tent@@ h of the em@@ bo@@ died energy of the entire house , unless you use con@@ cre@@ te or wood for a much lower em@@ bo@@ died energy .
very un@@ sett@@ ling for people working in path@@ ology lab@@ s .
now , there &apos;s one of our favorite po@@ em@@ s from the defen@@ ders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; take coura@@ ge friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the sta@@ kes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot;
you f@@ ence in animals . you electri@@ fy the inside .
unfortunately , we don &apos;t do great with up@@ per@@ -@@ lim@@ b pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics .
here &apos;s why .
the only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the di@@ ving animals and the di@@ ving birds .
one of the places we put in a big oil project in ch@@ ad , with ex@@ x@@ on .
in 2008 , we repor@@ ted the complete syn@@ thesis of the my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um genome , a little over 50@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code , but we have not yet succe@@ e@@ ded in bo@@ ot@@ ing up that chromo@@ some .
and then came one of the biggest gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ ps of my life .
what if bi@@ ologists could only study animals that made people go , &quot; aw@@ w . &quot; right ?
i showed this slide to lar@@ ry page , who just jo@@ ined our board .
you &apos;re not one of the beautiful people .
this picture is taken at 16 kilometers .
what &apos;s interesting is they did it in south america and canada , where it &apos;s &quot; more eth@@ ical to give plac@@ e@@ bo@@ s . &quot;
good morning . my name is david ro@@ se .
a trans@@ discipl@@ in@@ ary study of co@@ operation ?
the o@@ ed has 3@@ 3 different num@@ ber@@ ed defini@@ tions for set .
i think that if we understood our cognitive limit@@ ations in the same way that we understand our physical limit@@ ations , even though they don &apos;t st@@ are us in the face in the same way , we could design a better world .
why not ch@@ is@@ el a coral re@@ e@@ f out of mar@@ ble ?
education . the kids never went to school .
c@@ c : mr. gele@@ hu@@ n , i &apos;d like to re@@ mind you , you &apos;re not on trial here today .
this young man po@@ sted a video of him ab@@ using his c@@ at on youtube .
the best image i know of this is from 6@@ 50 years ago .
bf : it is , it &apos;s weird . you wouldn &apos;t think it would affect half the stage , but it is . it &apos;s weird .
they took that video and they em@@ bed@@ ded it in their 40@@ 4 page and it was like a light bul@@ b went off for everybody in the place .
but i think it &apos;s important to have these places .
how are we going to motiv@@ ate people to actually trans@@ late the web for free ?
companies make goods , but governments , they make public goods . they work on the cure for cancer and educ@@ ating our children and making roads , but we don &apos;t have institutions that are particularly good at this kind of complexity . we don &apos;t have institutions that are good at bringing our tal@@ ents to bear , at working with us in this kind of open and collabor@@ ative way .
but not only that .
that &apos;s in his auto@@ bi@@ ograph@@ y .
they were able to create something wonderful .
now , that &apos;s a little un@@ fair . some of my best friends are architec@@ ts . and they definitely do have e@@ ars .
and i &apos;ve been working for the past 20 years on a population of see@@ d-@@ eating ants in sou@@ the@@ astern ari@@ zon@@ a .
now , if you look at what that ad@@ jac@@ ent property is worth , you could actually buy the property , cut down the s@@ hr@@ u@@ b@@ ber@@ y to improve the sight line , and then sell it off again .
and the other thing about this em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment is that there &apos;s kind of what i call the m@@ clu@@ han rever@@ sal .
mean@@ while , you have the tv blog@@ gers going out on stri@@ ke , in sym@@ pathy with the television wri@@ ters .
the problem is absolutely solu@@ ble , and even solu@@ ble in a way that &apos;s reas@@ on@@ ably cheap .
they kno@@ ck themselves off .
in some it is hot .
he &apos;s got no legs .
because it &apos;s the first thing we draw ; we surro@@ und ourselves with images of it ; it &apos;s probably the most common image on the planet .
&quot; i don &apos;t know , guys .
it &apos;s an idea that started from my first discussion .
one was just a little verse that said , &quot; no written word , no spo@@ ken ple@@ a can teach our you@@ th what they should be .
the b@@ ard said everything best , of course , and he &apos;s making my point here but he &apos;s making it hyper@@ bo@@ li@@ cally : &quot; &apos; tis nothing good or bad / but thinking makes it so . &quot;
of course , but if you &apos;ve seen the cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn &apos;t a question of &quot; let &apos;s leave the tree for tomorrow . &quot;
instead , it sil@@ ently sli@@ ps into the bacteria &apos;s own dna , and it just sta@@ ys there like a terror@@ ist sle@@ e@@ per cell , waiting for in@@ struc@@ tions .
the longer the ex@@ pos@@ ure goes on for , the more detail you get .
it &apos;s about enjo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e sounds .
the politicians i &apos;ve met are generally very ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted , friend@@ ly , very so@@ cially sk@@ ill@@ ful people , and that &apos;s the nature of politics . you &apos;ve got to make relationships , make de@@ als , you &apos;ve got to ca@@ jo@@ le , please , fl@@ at@@ ter , you &apos;ve got to use your personal skills , and that &apos;s the way politics has always worked .
the lear@@ ner could be midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged , could be as young as 20 .
so i &apos;ve got to get there and be in complete pan@@ ic .
bf : i &apos;m going to run up behind him .
so what i did was i made an ad@@ vent@@ ure stri@@ p .
and we worked very clo@@ sely with the whole thing being a team effort , and with wonderful results like that flight .
well , what we &apos;ve shown is that , first of all , we can actually give the mon@@ keys a financial cur@@ ren@@ cy , and they do very similar things with it .
bor@@ ders between the bo@@ s@@ ni@@ ak terri@@ tory and the bo@@ s@@ ni@@ an-@@ ser@@ b terri@@ tory have cal@@ med down .
this is a series of light bo@@ xes i made for a show in it@@ al@@ y .
so this creates pul@@ ses of light that last a fe@@ m@@ to@@ second .
she sle@@ pt with the hy@@ en@@ as . she hi@@ d at night .
we can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier , but ultimately , what we &apos;re trying to do is really connect with one other person .
what &apos;s behind that is a po@@ stu@@ lation , nam@@ ely that not humans should get much more technical in the future ; rather than that , technology , a bit more human .
i couldn &apos;t pick a career .
in 2011 three young women swe@@ pt the top pri@@ zes of the first google science fair . lau@@ ren ho@@ dge , sh@@ re@@ e bo@@ se and na@@ om@@ i sha@@ h describe their extraordinary projects -- and their rou@@ te to a passion for science . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
we need to start acting .
but it &apos;s even a better deal for heavy tru@@ cks , where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gall@@ on , with better a@@ ero@@ dynam@@ ics and ti@@ r@@ es and eng@@ ines , and so on , and taking out weight so you can put it into pay@@ load .
and it &apos;s produced a great am@@ pu@@ tation , a s@@ hal@@ low view of human nature .
i played a lot of ch@@ ess .
two years ago , you saw this cre@@ ature .
and then i said , &quot; close your eyes . &quot;
and so i think we can roll the video that we have .
so , we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .
and then i thought no , no . i should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way i really talk because , after all , this is the great un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling .
but we know what &apos;s going on in these houses , you know .
and all of a sudden , out of the dark , from the other end of the square , i saw the gl@@ int of mir@@ r@@ ors li@@ t by the moon .
i want to introdu@@ ce you to some of those entreprene@@ urs i &apos;ve met and share with you some of what they &apos;ve taught me over the years .
wonderful .
we just happen to make great computers .
i think i in@@ her@@ it it from my mother , who , used to cra@@ w@@ l around the house on all f@@ ours .
but i cannot say , &quot; you think , therefore you are , &quot; because &quot; you &quot; are within my per@@ cep@@ tual bubble .
and somehow , this is trans@@ formed -- the ye@@ ast bur@@ ps and swe@@ ats are later trans@@ formed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transforma@@ tional food , and we &apos;re going to explore that in a minute .
i &apos;d never been very good at fix@@ ing stuff when i was living my old life , but it &apos;s amazing how resour@@ ce@@ ful you can become when you &apos;re in the middle of the ocean and there &apos;s only one way to get to the other side .
by 19@@ 29 , electric light was everywhere .
so not only would he get me one , but i had to get two , and then he wanted me to hi@@ re someone to deliver half the pa@@ pers , which i did , and then i realized that colle@@ cting ti@@ ps was where you made all the money .
they didn &apos;t get very far , obviously .
today , when we hear the thre@@ ats of war and the high r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic , we &apos;re o@@ f@@ ten@@ times led to believe that this is yet another one of those uns@@ ol@@ vable middle eastern confli@@ cts with roots as old as the region itself .
that &apos;ll give me something i can use , and i &apos;m going to contra@@ ct with someone .
and the reason why that &apos;s happening is that , right now , in 2007 -- the technology that we are using -- a transi@@ st@@ or is big enough that several electr@@ ons can flow through the chan@@ nel simul@@ tane@@ ously , side by side .
how fab@@ ul@@ ous . why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car ?
they won &apos;t necessarily be easy lives , but in the end , it is all that will susta@@ in us .
i guess most of you by now realize that we do : 300 days of sun .
the first is that the movement , such as it is , st@@ ops at america &apos;s bor@@ ders . it is not a global movement .
these are spor@@ es -- this is in their spor@@ es .
if you im@@ it@@ ate something , maybe you can have an effect on it .
not just at how you would do it better , but also what all the risks and down@@ sides of it are .
history pro@@ ves that it doesn &apos;t matter whether you come from a coun@@ cil e@@ state or a country e@@ state .
i &apos;m pretty sure my dad doesn &apos;t know it .
so here is a picture of the high se@@ as as seen from above -- that area in the dar@@ ker blue .
and then one day i said , &quot; why don &apos;t we just do an oral v@@ acc@@ ine ? &quot;
it &apos;s home to only 2,000 people , and like a lot of other small to@@ w@@ ns it has been hol@@ lo@@ wed out over the years .
that &apos;s from robert bru@@ stein , the famous dra@@ ma cri@@ tic and director , in the new re@@ public about five years ago .
so moment@@ um is good . don &apos;t stop .
remember that in the majority of univer@@ ses , you don &apos;t even exist in the first place .
and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure , the architecture of the ties , was changing across time .
simple as that , right ? no big@@ gie .
they are able to respond to gravity , of course , so the sho@@ ots are growing against the v@@ ec@@ tor of gravity and the roots toward the v@@ ec@@ tor of gravity .
and as david lee ro@@ th san@@ g in &quot; just a gi@@ gol@@ o , &quot; &quot; i a@@ in &apos;t got no body . &quot;
is biology special ?
but the experiment is not the end of the story , because you still have to trans@@ mit that knowledge to other people .
and , approach@@ ing a building from a distance , you don &apos;t see too much ; you get a little closer , and you arri@@ ve at a nice little com@@ position that might re@@ mind you of a mon@@ dri@@ an or a di@@ eben@@ kor@@ n or something .
it &apos;s the last stage , just like a sc@@ ar .
in short , it &apos;s deci@@ ding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that .
so , sh@@ red@@ dies is actually producing a new product , which is something very exciting for them .
i &apos;ll just swim right through them .
we understood mountains under com@@ pres@@ sion , but we could not understand why we had a mountain under ten@@ sion .
and we need to shift sub@@ si@@ dies from the oil industry , which is at least 10 billion dollars a year , into something that allows midd@@ le-@@ class people to find better ways to com@@ mu@@ te .
well , what should our at@@ titude be towards this world that we see very rapi@@ dly developing before us ?
and this is how we come to care for the common good .
and they actually had to end up shu@@ tting down the leader board because while it was effective , it was so powerful that it stopped sour@@ cing the best stories and started having people work to main@@ tain their leadership .
it &apos;s transforma@@ tional .
the ne@@ on sign is fi@@ z@@ zing and cra@@ cking .
and the ath@@ ab@@ as@@ ca river dra@@ ins down@@ stream to a range of ab@@ original communities .
it &apos;s more than all other manufacturing , in fact .
you would be cor@@ rect .
ma@@ d@@ ame , would you like some of those orange ban@@ gles with the p@@ ink pol@@ ka dots ?
and maybe even a giant girl in a ho@@ o@@ die will connect with what you &apos;ve shared .
whereas nature ten@@ ds to be small , and cur@@ ved , and it ben@@ ds and twi@@ sts , and has legs instead , and app@@ en@@ da@@ ges , and has many mus@@ cles and many , many sensor@@ s .
at any rate , it was a fascinating place , but unfortunately , australia didn &apos;t stay this way .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;ll see on this graph -- it begins in 197@@ 3 , just before women start f@@ loo@@ ding the work@@ force , and it brings us up to our current day .
culture where creativity was consum@@ ed but the consumer is not a cre@@ ator .
i was about to start a robo@@ tic operation , but ste@@ pping out of the el@@ ev@@ ator into the bright and gl@@ aring lights of the operating room , i realized that my left visual field was fast collap@@ sing into dar@@ k@@ ness .
now what we actually compu@@ ted in our study was the control over the t@@ n@@ cs &apos; value .
since then , it &apos;s happened again in london , it &apos;s happening internation@@ ally , and across the country .
religion and political carto@@ ons , as you may have heard , make a difficult couple , ever since that day of 2005 , when a bunch of carto@@ oni@@ sts in den@@ mark dre@@ w carto@@ ons that had re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sions all over the world -- demon@@ stra@@ tions , f@@ at@@ wa , they pro@@ vo@@ ked violence . people died in the violence .
okay ? that had a big effect on me .
it &apos;s not geogra@@ ph@@ y .
but what a liber@@ ating thing to realize that our problems , in fact , are probably our rich@@ est sources for ris@@ ing to this ulti@@ mate virtu@@ e of compassion , towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and jo@@ ys of others .
and after all , poor countries , like rich countries , one thing we &apos;ve got equal , is their days are the same l@@ ength : 24 hours .
van@@ ne@@ v@@ ar bush with his me@@ me@@ x -- this idea of all of human knowledge at your finger@@ ti@@ ps -- he had this vision .
so , why was psychology good ?
this is a well-@@ known phenomenon . you eat certain things , you produce a lot of gas . it may turn out that biological processes in co@@ al@@ min@@ es have the same process . if that is true , then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to ri@@ p whole moun@@ tain@@ tops off , and it may not be to burn coal . it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture .
my name is z@@ am@@ in .
we &apos;ve had a mom in u@@ ta@@ h who used them with her kids , to a science resear@@ cher in the u.k. , and cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um develop@@ ers in ha@@ wa@@ ii .
so it &apos;s a very simple algorith@@ m .
and over the last decade , i travel@@ ed to over 40 countries to see ja@@ gu@@ ars and be@@ ars and eleph@@ ants and ti@@ gers and r@@ hin@@ os .
when leaving your laboratory tomorrow , i want you to stop by the re@@ hab@@ ili@@ tation center to watch in@@ ju@@ red people fighting to take a step , strug@@ gling to main@@ tain their tr@@ un@@ k .
it &apos;s something which has spread incredibly fast .
and doing on ti@@ tan what rain does on the earth : it car@@ ves gul@@ lies ; it forms ri@@ vers and cat@@ ar@@ acts ; it can create c@@ any@@ ons ; it can pool in large bas@@ ins and cr@@ at@@ ers .
and for@@ give the complicated diagra@@ m .
i see it everywhere .
and if you take a look at that , this was actually in a book that i wrote that de@@ als with artificial life .
so since i was here last in &apos; 0@@ 6 , we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue , so we covered that fairly exten@@ si@@ vely in skep@@ tic magazine .
we will talk today about local warming .
we &apos;re at the very beginning of something that , what we &apos;re seeing and the way that mes@@ h companies are coming forward , is invi@@ ting , it &apos;s eng@@ aging , but it &apos;s very early .
it &apos;s that he challen@@ ged another assu@@ mption , that every gi@@ ver should have his or her own fund or foundation .
after the race , he to@@ s@@ sed his we@@ t , clou@@ d-@@ white hair and said , &apos; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , ander@@ son , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
we are a company in the field of auto@@ ma@@ tion , and we &apos;d like to do very ligh@@ t@@ weight structures because that &apos;s energy efficient , and we &apos;d like to learn more about p@@ neu@@ ma@@ tics and air flow phenomen@@ a .
in the ocean , it &apos;s the rule rather than the ex@@ ception .
i grew up with family , friends , reading to me , and i loved the war@@ m@@ th and the breath and the clo@@ sen@@ ess of people reading .
this is over ti@@ lam@@ o@@ ok , or@@ eg@@ on .
usually -- one hop@@ es -- inno@@ cent@@ ly , but mis@@ repres@@ ented evidence .
is everything okay ?
this was truly , truly an ear@@ l@@ y-@@ adop@@ ter product -- the 19@@ 0@@ 5 sk@@ inner vac@@ u@@ um .
and that , to me , today , is now the challenge and the fun of my job , suppor@@ ting the vision of my cur@@ ators , whether it &apos;s an exhi@@ bi@@ tion of sam@@ u@@ ra@@ i s@@ words , early by@@ z@@ ant@@ ine arti@@ facts , ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance portra@@ its , or the show we heard mentioned earlier , the mc@@ queen show , with which we enjo@@ yed so much success last summer .
which a lot of you are like , &quot; how did he figure that out ? &quot;
her mother the queen said , &quot; who will mar@@ ry a whi@@ st@@ ling prin@@ cess ? &quot;
that &apos;s the in@@ fer@@ red task tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory , and here &apos;s the robot moving at the speed of the human .
there &apos;s a lot of un@@ known , and you often don &apos;t know what it is except by its ab@@ sen@@ ce .
which one of those two is cor@@ rect ?
i &apos;ve been fascin@@ ated with cro@@ p diversity for about 35 years from now , ever since i st@@ um@@ bled across a fairly ob@@ sc@@ ure acade@@ mic article by a guy named jack har@@ lan .
so what a fe@@ tus is learning about in u@@ ter@@ o is not mo@@ z@@ art &apos;s &quot; magic fl@@ ute &quot; but answers to questions much more critical to its survival .
some people will say it &apos;s for public health research .
and through these sort of generations of design meetings we arri@@ ve at a design .
that is changing the way we create our organizations , we do our government policy and we live our lives .
they say three percent of the population li@@ kes classi@@ cal music .
dan me@@ yer : math class needs a ma@@ ke@@ over
so it was only just the other week that i heard london &apos;s me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan police com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er talking about why the police need access to all of our communic@@ ations , sp@@ ying on us without any ju@@ di@@ cial over@@ sight , and he said it was a matter of life and death .
you can &apos;t see light . when it &apos;s dark , in a vac@@ u@@ um , if a person sh@@ ines a be@@ am of light straight across your eyes , you won &apos;t see it . slightly technical , some physi@@ ci@@ sts will dis@@ agree with this .
they got heal@@ thi@@ er . i made more money .
most of these distin@@ ctive sig@@ nature whi@@ st@@ les are quite stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed and stable through the life of a dolph@@ in .
this is what &apos;s happened in the last 28 years .
by dis@@ playing des@@ pair , hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , the media is telling the truth about africa , and nothing but the truth .
but the fact is , this is evidence of a living body on other bodies , ro@@ cks that have been the subject of ge@@ ological forma@@ tion , ero@@ sion , the action of time on objects .
yeah , we lau@@ gh , but this is how we move the message , and moving that message is how we connect international , inter@@ agen@@ cy , privat@@ e-@@ public , and these social nets to help create security .
and so we can exponenti@@ ally reduce the number of dna str@@ ands we use , if we use coun@@ ting , if we use a little bit of compu@@ tation .
all right , so tie me to the ma@@ st . &quot;
and we found three .
in ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela , one of the most popular so@@ ap oper@@ as has a hero@@ ine called cr@@ y@@ st@@ al .
in a brilli@@ antly ton@@ gu@@ e-@@ in-@@ che@@ ek analysis , se@@ ba@@ stian wer@@ ni@@ cke turns the tools of statisti@@ cal analysis on ted@@ to come up with a me@@ tri@@ c for creating &quot; the opti@@ m@@ um ted@@ talk &quot; based on user rat@@ ings . how do you rate it ? &quot; ja@@ w-@@ dro@@ pping &quot; ? &quot; un@@ convin@@ cing &quot; ? or just pla@@ in &quot; funny &quot; ?
she said , &quot; please , sing for me . &quot;
but then we negoti@@ ate on what they &apos;re going to get paid .
so when we talk about , now , the future we will create , one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in .
he then moved across into what we called the habit@@ at team .
what you find at the store at the corner , without going to any kind of fan@@ cy store , is the kind of re@@ fin@@ ed design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisti@@ cated .
so , because this is as much a philosop@@ hi@@ cal ad@@ v@@ ance as a technical ad@@ v@@ ance in science , we tried to deal with both the philosop@@ hi@@ cal and the technical side .
as late as 199@@ 2 , ib@@ m was known to say you couldn &apos;t possibly build a corpo@@ rate network using internet proto@@ co@@ l .
this is the only part that &apos;s battery bac@@ ked up .
we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas .
it was about their energy .
let me give you an example of what i mean by har@@ m@@ less but tab@@ o@@ o sexual practice . we gave them scen@@ ari@@ os .
but of course not all of them were that small .
so i do believe that architecture as i see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have , in every inti@@ ma@@ cy that we pos@@ s@@ ess .
in fact , we de@@ value play .
you know this gentle@@ man , right ?
but they happened to be wild dogs living there , and it was right by the water , so there were s@@ w@@ ans and du@@ cks swi@@ mming around and trees growing everywhere and bees ne@@ sting in the sugar bar@@ rel@@ s .
and that &apos;s especially because this world population is increasing , and it &apos;s increasing , not only in numbers , but we &apos;re also getting weal@@ thi@@ er , and anyone that gets weal@@ thi@@ er starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat .
and y@@ u@@ d@@ h@@ is@@ thir@@ a repli@@ ed , &quot; the most won@@ dr@@ ous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don &apos;t realize it can happen to us . &quot;
and that , i guess , is probably the fin@@ est argument for leaving the house .
m@@ j : well we know india and pakistan had nuclear energy first , and then they developed nuclear weapons secre@@ tly in the fac@@ tor@@ ies .
it &apos;s made of metal and the brown stuff is fin@@ -@@ p@@ ly -- it &apos;s that formed l@@ um@@ ber from fin@@ land .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day night is eating dis@@ orders .
and the best thing is , they &apos;ll also last for more than 20 years .
if we cut all the complexity away , we have the problem of scale .
20 percent are getting treated .
well , it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two bi@@ ases that we have at the psych@@ ological level .
cru@@ el@@ ty : i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we , hypo@@ cri@@ tically , wouldn &apos;t even consider for our own cat@@ s , dogs and other pe@@ ts .
kan@@ z@@ i choo@@ ses a fla@@ ke he thinks is shar@@ p enough .
for example , i saw pictures and images frequ@@ ently of sa@@ dness and suffering .
think about the group of mom@@ s who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group , and almost none of them buy lots of jun@@ k food .
and i think that the way you &apos;re going to get what you want , or cause the change that you want to change , to happen , is that you &apos;ve got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread .
&quot; why ? &quot;
so why is such a pl@@ enti@@ ful and valuable material not re@@ covered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ?
here is in the field hospital .
because they all started at the same time with the bo@@ om about 20 years ago .
we also need to mobili@@ ze afri@@ cans in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , not only to go into the traditional sec@@ tors , but to go into agriculture and also to in@@ sti@@ gate change from within .
okay , there &apos;s a few he@@ art@@ brea@@ ks that cho@@ col@@ ate can &apos;t fix .
ok ? so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it .
it was really more from the stand@@ point of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and in@@ spir@@ ing one ?
may i introdu@@ ce major general al@@ bert stu@@ b@@ b@@ leb@@ ine i@@ ii , com@@ man@@ der of military intelligence in 198@@ 3 .
and so that &apos;s the message that i had .
but as this ring ro@@ tat@@ es at about 1,@@ 700 r@@ p@@ m -- that &apos;s 28 times per second .
i heard people mur@@ mu@@ r from time to time that i should love my body , so i learned how to do this .
and there i was , lying there in this tiny space , hot , dark , c@@ lau@@ st@@ rop@@ ho@@ bi@@ c , mat@@ ch@@ bo@@ x-@@ si@@ zed , behind my eyes , but it was really weird , like , after this went on for days , weeks , months , that space would get bigger and dar@@ ker and cool@@ er until i really looked forward to that half an hour of en@@ forced im@@ mo@@ bility and rest , and i really looked forward to going to that place of dar@@ k@@ ness .
so there &apos;s an interesting pattern , but we don &apos;t have enough data here to actually see the pattern .
and they were looking at the net@@ fli@@ x qu@@ eu@@ es , and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zi@@ p right up and out to our houses .
and they said to him , &quot; who are you , and what are you doing here ? &quot;
this is the reason why i created , with david ed@@ ward , a scientist of harvard university , an object able to absor@@ b the tox@@ ic elements using those kind of plants .
and finally , human resources : conven@@ tional wisdom says hi@@ re battery experts , seas@@ oned profession@@ als , who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge .
and i was privi@@ le@@ ged because i was born into a family , my father would always encoura@@ ge the boys and the girls .
nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .
and they also taught me about listening -- that they listen@@ ed to me .
and she wanted to make something of her life , and she asked me a simple little question .
it could be a phone number , it could be an e-@@ mail address , it could be a post@@ al address .
he doesn &apos;t care .
the more and more symme@@ try you have , the better you exhi@@ bit the simpli@@ city and elegan@@ ce of the theory .
i was walking onto a plane -- this , for me , was a pi@@ vot@@ al moment in my career , and it really c@@ em@@ ented what i wanted to do with this whole pu@@ pp@@ y-@@ training thing , the notion of how to teach pu@@ pp@@ ies in a do@@ g-@@ friend@@ ly way to want to do what we want to do , so we don &apos;t have to force them .
we plan to laun@@ ch this product in india in 2010 , and the target price point will be 25 dollars , less than 0@@ .@@ 1 percent of the cost of a traditional in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or .
you either don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for , or you &apos;re looking in the wrong place , &quot; he said .
one of the things that we work on at sc@@ v@@ n@@ g@@ r is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses , to sort of something that is very key to the economy .
and then my university education as an ec@@ ologist rein@@ forced my belie@@ fs .
it was built by the grand@@ est sun king , of the grand@@ est c@@ it@@ y-@@ state , of the grand@@ est civilization of the americ@@ as , the may@@ as .
again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radi@@ cally fast , in about two to five years .
you &apos;re just telling yourself , &quot; without you , commit@@ ment device , i am nothing , i have no self-@@ discipl@@ ine . &quot;
and it &apos;s obvious from the diagra@@ m that every unit of energy you save at the whe@@ els is going to avoid wa@@ sting another seven un@@ its of energy getting that energy to the whe@@ els .
he &apos;s got a purpose . but he comes home &#91; to &#93; kan@@ s@@ as city , mis@@ sour@@ i , maybe he goes to college , maybe he &apos;s got a job , but he doesn &apos;t have that same sense of purpose .
can i believe in this this passion@@ ately ?
then in the same week , at a fun@@ er@@ al , we san@@ g the familiar hy@@ m@@ n &quot; we p@@ low the fields and sc@@ at@@ ter , &quot; a very english hy@@ m@@ n .
so we have to raise some money .
i work at the cambridge hospital .
in this image of the to@@ k@@ yo sky@@ line , i &apos;ve hidden data from the ne@@ west planet@@ -@@ hun@@ ting space telescop@@ e on the block , the ke@@ pl@@ er mission .
i shared it with a gentle@@ man called bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ dy j@@ r . , who is one of my i@@ d@@ ols .
the science is that simple .
and it won &apos;t be easy -- that &apos;s for sure .
now in an urban environment , that &apos;s extra@@ ordin@@ arily difficult .
ok . all scientists aren &apos;t like that .
i grew up am@@ on@@ gst those animals .
they started out with such promise on africa .
this is a photograph from when i vis@@ ited p@@ ru@@ d@@ ho@@ e bay in al@@ as@@ ka in 200@@ 2 to watch the miner@@ als management service testing their ability to burn oil sp@@ ills in ice .
all right , a political scientist , it doesn &apos;t really count , but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is mich@@ ig@@ an , and , like any good scientist , i was experim@@ enting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number .
they connect people to one another .
these auth@@ ors have been stri@@ ving to write books .
and , ok , so stop there . this was -- you had some a@@ ward i think ?
that &apos;s what the government says is okay to feed our kids .
it was hard on the cat@@ s , but it made a great little instrument .
and the world &apos;s population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion , late this century .
and my daughter , who &apos;s three , when i dro@@ pped her off at pres@@ cho@@ ol , did that whole hu@@ g@@ g@@ ing-@@ the-@@ leg , cr@@ ying , &quot; mom@@ my , don &apos;t get on the plane &quot; thing .
a lot of companies have fallen into that conven@@ tional wisdom .
and we started a studio .
our next questions was : could we actually visu@@ alize this spread ?
ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness , and he was right .
and most of the time , you &apos;ll find this inse@@ ct lives in and around your home , so this -- whatever we do has got to get to that inse@@ ct .
those are the questions i learned at health leads , not in medical school . &quot;
first , what do good argu@@ ers win when they win an argument ?
i don &apos;t know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way .
medical anima@@ tor david bol@@ in@@ sky pres@@ ents 3 minutes of stun@@ ning anima@@ tion that show the bu@@ st@@ ling life inside a cell .
you can &apos;t deal with the economic and financial problem .
and you want a leader who in@@ spir@@ es and challenges and makes you want to be a better citi@@ zen . right ?
well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a fil@@ ler , and we became very famous in ic@@ eland , went to ic@@ eland and spoke about this issue .
and so they are po@@ ckets of par@@ o@@ chi@@ alism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are main@@ stream .
you understand that you can pre@@ p@@ are , but the amount of prepar@@ ation you can do is limited -- you can take some water , you can have a map , you can have a pack .
you think i &apos;ll be able to drive it ? &quot;
free@@ man thomas says , &quot; i &apos;m driven by my passion . &quot;
if i project that , that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don &apos;t crash on my motor@@ bi@@ ke .
gh : ok . c , g , b , a and e .
you know , you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry , where you had these two atoms , they &apos;re close together , and the electr@@ ons are moving around . that tiny force is suff@@ i@@ cient to allow them to do that because it &apos;s ad@@ ded up so many times with these small structures .
imagine if a team of surge@@ ons could fly into the brain , as though it was a world , and see tis@@ su@@ es as landscap@@ es , and hear blood den@@ sity levels as music .
if you haven &apos;t heard it , raise your hand .

he impres@@ sed in the private sector , developing chemical appli@@ cations for the oil industry while simul@@ tane@@ ously running a worldwide bank and credit card fr@@ au@@ d operation that was worth millions until his ar@@ rest in 2008 .
and if they said yes , we gave them the one that they built and we broke .
this is a very bad system because what happens is your hur@@ d@@ le rate gets set very low . people come up with really smart ideas for solar pan@@ els , or for wind , or for something else , and then guess what ?

you think it &apos;s bad to lose one arm ?
it &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s func@@ tional .
he &apos;s now been published in five books .
and one in particular , is one that we &apos;re working on with the ac@@ u@@ men fund , in a project that &apos;s been fund@@ ed by the bill and mel@@ in@@ da gates foundation .
and it &apos;s not just at@@ ra@@ zine they &apos;re ex@@ posed to .
we might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently ris@@ en up to fight against leg@@ isla@@ tive in@@ cur@@ sion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
we &apos;re really domin@@ ated now by those things that we &apos;re using up faster and faster and faster .
and again , food could be said to be the or@@ der@@ ing principle of his vision .
i said , &quot; you &apos;re thinking about this just way too early . &quot;
let me high@@ light it for you .
i met my ho@@ st family . things went quite well i think , all things considered .
and toward the end , he said , &quot; if you would know the p@@ ine tree , go to the p@@ ine tree . &quot;
and in some parts of the world , they use tools , like spon@@ ges to h@@ unt fish .
can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
but exactly four years after , the photos , most of them are still there .
she told me , &quot; when you &apos;re discipl@@ ing your children , sit in an up@@ right chair with a c@@ us@@ hi@@ oned surface .
so it &apos;s a lot sa@@ fer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street .
so in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , the u.s. was first .
everyone who works in the cul@@ in@@ ary world knows that the first stage of cooking is &quot; mis@@ e en place , &quot; which is just a french way of saying , &quot; get organized . &quot;
and my look to the future is , and what i want to do with this do@@ g@@ g@@ y stuff , is to teach people that you know , your husband &apos;s just as easy to train .
but if instead i start to meet a higher number of nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers , i &apos;m less likely to for@@ age .
well in our research , we &apos;ve found that these changes are gro@@ unded fundament@@ ally in the uni@@ qu@@ ely human ability to monit@@ or time -- not just clock time and cal@@ end@@ ar time , but lifetime .
you know , the computer and television both recently turned 60 , and today i &apos;d like to talk about their relationship .
the second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around .
and of course you all know exactly what this is , right ?
right , and do you have a web address that we might look for yet ?
very good , mother . move ahead .
it &apos;s a major subject .
it completely blo@@ ws apart the way that per@@ fu@@ me is , and provi@@ des a whole new form@@ at .
there &apos;s a frame@@ work , which is the dark matter , the invisible matter , that &apos;s out there that &apos;s actually holding it all together .
do we have any idea how we could have de@@ fe@@ ated ne@@ anderth@@ als if they also had language ?
and now the same piece of music with 9@@ 8 percent of the data re@@ moved .
it wasn &apos;t just a matter of tun@@ ing up some graphi@@ cs rou@@ tin@@ es .
and if that were all this was about , then it would be an interesting thing .
either we &apos;re back where we started and the sur@@ ge has had no effect ; or finally the groups have been frag@@ mented to the ex@@ tent that we can start to think about maybe moving out .
all those other values , all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing , we sum@@ mar@@ ize .
and i study that in the natural world , the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness of species .
so that &apos;s where we get our ni@@ tro@@ gen from .
well , i started making com@@ ics , but i also started trying to understand them , almost immediately .
and that of all the technologies that were explo@@ ited to make that car@@ na@@ ge come into being , probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that en@@ able 5@@ 0,000 people to live in two buildings 1@@ 10 stories above the ground .
zo@@ e : stop .
it &apos;s cool for me .
and this can be a problem , as i learned .
and they are working with me up to today .
there &apos;s a waste of time ; there &apos;s a waste of space ; there &apos;s a waste of energy ; and there &apos;s a waste of waste .
which means that , while we all have one bi@@ ograph@@ y , they have many .
unfortunately , the news is not all good .
and the night before , we cam@@ ped , and my ti@@ bet@@ an friends said , &quot; we are going to sleep outside . &quot; and i said , &quot; why ? we have enough space in the tent . &quot;
so , i made this image out of bar@@ b@@ ie doll@@ s , and so , as you stand back you see this kind of fl@@ oral pattern , and as you get all the way back , you see 3@@ 2,000 bar@@ b@@ ie doll@@ s , which represents the number of breast aug@@ ment@@ ation sur@@ ger@@ ies that are per@@ formed in the u.s. each month .
that means you had to know i exi@@ sted .
i kept finding myself at her page .
the micro@@ bes in your mouth can fres@@ hen your breath , or not , and the key thing is that our personal eco@@ systems interact with eco@@ systems on everything we touch .
this is what the u.k. government target on carbon and green@@ house emissions looks like .
what i rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not .
these organisms we now bring into the lab , and you can see some of them growing on pe@@ tr@@ i pl@@ ates , and get them to re@@ produce the pre@@ cise bi@@ om@@ in@@ er@@ als that we find on the walls of these ca@@ ves .
he has personal experiences that i would give my left leg to have in my head .
mand@@ ela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa : peace , re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , harmon@@ y .
there is a potential to do good as well .
and i said , &quot; what do i do ? &quot;
it takes about seven hours to print a kid@@ ney , so this is about three hours into it now .
we found activity in other brain regi@@ ons also -- in a brain region associated with calcul@@ ating ga@@ ins and los@@ ses .
and you look up at the sky through a hole in the clou@@ ds you see the mon@@ a@@ ster@@ y at the top of the mu@@ h@@ ra@@ ka -- that &apos;s where you &apos;re supposed to clim@@ b now -- and you say , &quot; there &apos;s no way that i could possibly get there . &quot;
she &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the surge@@ on does his thing -- stit@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the re@@ co@@ very room .
in some years in texas , we &apos;ve ex@@ ecu@@ ted close to 40 people , and this number has never signific@@ antly dec@@ lin@@ ed over the last 15 years .
it actually re@@ minds me of the most important lesson re@@ gre@@ t can teach us , which is also one of the most important lessons life teach@@ es us .
so if you look at questions like this , life satis@@ fac@@ tion , you see life satis@@ fac@@ tion going up with each r@@ ung of income .
ak : ha@@ a ha@@ a ha@@ a@@ a .
a transi@@ tive ver@@ b mand@@ ates that there has to be an object there : &quot; sam de@@ v@@ ou@@ red the pi@@ zza . &quot; you can &apos;t just say , &quot; sam de@@ v@@ ou@@ red . &quot;
but - 1 , - 1 - 1 , are all prime numbers .
stay here . i &apos;ve got a question .
here it is : &quot; this island earth . &quot;
so i said , &quot; yes , a &apos; rever@@ se fishing licen@@ se . &apos; &quot; so we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
so watch this individual here , and what he &apos;s trying to do is set up a nest .
for us , we &apos;re very fac@@ i@@ le around electricity .
we push that material to ex@@ tru@@ ders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make sp@@ ag@@ he@@ t@@ ti@@ -@@ like plastic str@@ ands .
thank you .
this is a cr@@ yo@@ preser@@ vation unit , and it hol@@ ds the bodies of the wife and mother of cr@@ y@@ on@@ ics pi@@ one@@ er robert et@@ t@@ inger , who hop@@ ed to be a@@ wo@@ ken one day to exten@@ ded life in good health , with advan@@ c@@ ements in science and technology , all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars , for forever .
this is communication technology for birds . i looks like this .
and after i took this photograph , they constru@@ cted a wall around the world church of god to mi@@ mic the se@@ t-@@ up of mo@@ squ@@ es in afghanistan or iraq .
it &apos;s my house , with the fer@@ r@@ ar@@ i out front .
it &apos;s a group of pro@@ p cra@@ zi@@ es just like me called the repli@@ ca pro@@ ps for@@ um , and it &apos;s people who trade , make and travel in information about movie pro@@ ps .
and we cannot see that as a problem .
so here &apos;s an over@@ head war@@ mer and a c@@ pa@@ p .
but even when we compare with the possible , instead of the past , we still make certain kinds of mistakes .
because i &apos;m thinking , if i &apos;m gay and i &apos;m doing something that &apos;s going to destro@@ y civilization , i need to figure out what this stuff is , and i need to stop doing it right now .
and when people have done a variety of studies , they have learned things such as , when a baby is born , during vag@@ in@@ al deli@@ very you get col@@ oni@@ zed by the micro@@ bes from your mother .
okay , so we &apos;re interested in these sorts of things .
finding a wea@@ pon that recogni@@ zes and sin@@ ks all of them makes the job that much harder .
in fact , i think they &apos;re putting up my grade six report .
oh yeah , when i don &apos;t feel so good down there , she takes care of me .
the idea of justice , which gives boundar@@ ies to our lives and gives us a feeling of what &apos;s right about life , what &apos;s right about living , what should we be doing , social justice .
this is an intern@@ al son@@ y camera . thank you , son@@ y .

red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop sig@@ ns .
friends , this has never happened , where everybody in the prison studies .
thank you .
what has changed our society has been wir@@ eless devices .
the outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the sun .
and the us@@ f@@ da has a j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tional problem .
it &apos;s critical now that when a car crash happens it isn &apos;t just the st@@ unt person we make safe , it &apos;s the cre@@ w .
its behavior is completely un@@ changed .
so today for the first time , we &apos;re un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling a new project , which is a collaboration with strat@@ as@@ ys , and it &apos;s called 4@@ d prin@@ ting .
recei@@ p@@ ts go down , some spending programs go up , but most of it is not because of that .
being on the same stage as al gore , who was the first person i ever vot@@ ed for .
we need to reduce the con@@ cre@@ te and steel and we need to grow bigger , and what we &apos;ve been working on is 3@@ 0-@@ story t@@ all buildings made of wood .
hasn &apos;t changed that much .
this is my favorite picture of consciousness that &apos;s ever been done .
and i &apos;ll close it there .
you can &apos;t . i don &apos;t even know if you can .
and remember , never ever swim with ag@@ gr@@ ession .
but no you don &apos;t .
he &apos;s like , &quot; a day . &quot;
i &apos;m going to disc@@ uss with you three of my inven@@ tions that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people , which we will hope to see happen .
and the cre@@ ator of this , he said , &quot; this is fire . i call this fire . &quot;
well , one of the things that is really critical to try to di@@ still from that experience is that in addition to that , people ask me and say , &quot; well , how did your parents treat you when you were a child ? &quot;
and so in this game , i &apos;ve learned so much from it , but i would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and le@@ verage something good for the world , they may save us all .
previous generations couldn &apos;t do this experiment at all .
it &apos;s going to be hard . i say we give it a shot anyway because we &apos;ve just come too far to scre@@ w it up now .
i mean that &apos;s pretty dra@@ matic for our own country .
ev@@ an gr@@ ant : let &apos;s do &quot; pull . &quot;
so here &apos;s the site . thank you .
i like to think of it as a kind of technologi@@ cal magic .
that &apos;s been do@@ g@@ ging me for the last 12 years was cre@@ di@@ ted certainly to this cha@@ p , the ra@@ k@@ ish@@ -@@ looking gentle@@ man standing at the back , second from the left , george lee m@@ all@@ ory . many of you will know his name .
it also is the second most popul@@ ated continent , with 9@@ 00 million people .
they &apos;re not o@@ be@@ ying the direc@@ tions that we &apos;re giving them , so we &apos;ll give them a shot of the o@@ .@@ c. spra@@ y .
so i &apos;d like to share with you , if i may , my experiences .
we must remember , and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old , that life appe@@ ars four billion years ago , around -- four billion point two ?
one of the real challenges is to inno@@ v@@ ate fundament@@ ally in education .
competition means , not only were there a hundred different political un@@ its in europe in 1@@ 500 , but within each of these un@@ its , there was competition between corpo@@ ra@@ tions as well as so@@ ver@@ eig@@ ns .
these are pi@@ p@@ eline rou@@ tes , which emer@@ ge from kur@@ di@@ stan , which is an o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region .
the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
we want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of th@@ under , who laugh@@ ed like the sun@@ rise , who came from that place called america , which is so far from here , that if a young man should travel there , he would be an old man when he arrived .
but what &apos;s very cool is when we actually combin@@ ed the two less po@@ tent te@@ as together , the combin@@ ation , the bl@@ end , is more po@@ tent than either one alone .
i don &apos;t know if this is called a bas@@ ket@@ -@@ br@@ a , but it ought to be something like that .
and then this is our answer to star@@ bucks in th@@ a@@ il@@ and -- &quot; coffee and con@@ dom@@ s . &quot;
and this is what the story &apos;s all about .
and he said , &quot; listen , this is the project i &apos;ve been looking for my whole life .
sometimes you turn on the news and you say , &quot; is there anyone left to ha@@ ck ? &quot;
the challenge occur@@ s when there is an in@@ j@@ ury .
but the good news is they are out there .
but what we have to recognize now is that we are reach@@ ing the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical limit@@ s that our planet can bear , and when we cho@@ p down fore@@ sts , as we are every day , to grow more and more food , when we extra@@ ct water from de@@ ple@@ ting water reser@@ ves , when we e@@ mit fossil fuel emissions in the qu@@ est to grow more and more food , and then we throw away so much of it , we have to think about what we can start saving .
it &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
now as i said before , bat@@ s are essential for our eco@@ systems to function cor@@ rec@@ tly . and why is this ?
this story ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed every country except iraq , and received 10 times the co@@ verage of the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report .
very , very little .
now it &apos;s 2011 .
&quot; i know that , hon@@ ey . get out of the car and go stand in the par@@ king space ti@@ ll i get there . &quot;
they were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way .
and i &apos;m most excited about how we &apos;re going to use them in science .
i would like , instead , to talk about how great some designers are .
he &apos;s at a technology conference in florida .
we need a critical number of women in posi@@ tions of power , and we need to nur@@ ture the fe@@ min@@ ine energy in men .
but governments hate the di@@ y economy , and that &apos;s why -- i took this picture in 2007 , and this is the same market in 2009 -- and i think , when the organi@@ z@@ ers of this conference were talking about radical open@@ ness , they didn &apos;t mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone .
so , very brie@@ fly , i &apos;ll just explain to you how this is done , because that &apos;s the more interesting part .
one kind of to@@ ken fe@@ e@@ ds only the partner who choo@@ ses , the other one fe@@ e@@ ds both of them .
now we &apos;re not going to do this in normal people .
i know a gentle@@ man , married for 25 years , who &apos;s lon@@ ging to hear his wife say , &quot; thank you for being the bre@@ ad@@ w@@ inner , so i can stay home with the kids , &quot; but won &apos;t ask .
it became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work , and it was used in a project where we could un@@ ra@@ vel that surface , and it was a figu@@ ra@@ tive idea that was going to be fol@@ ded and made into a very , kind of complex space .
in fact , it goes against natural survival .
and all because he decided to walk that day .
so this is happening in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
but none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
on one occasi@@ on , she said she saw a man in a stri@@ ped shir@@ t in a restaurant .
and what happens to the social environment when people see other people be@@ have around them ?
the cro@@ ws learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the co@@ in to come out , put the co@@ in in the s@@ lot , and then they get their pe@@ an@@ ut .
but it &apos;s also very serious because all this acc@@ essi@@ bility stuff started coming up , where people can &apos;t use computers , necessarily .
this is probably the most bor@@ ing top@@ ic of the whole morning .
in &quot; bra@@ ve new world , &quot; he imag@@ ines a society where technologies that we created origin@@ ally for freedom end up co@@ er@@ cing us .
that is , if you said to them , cat@@ s are like wild@@ cat@@ s .
and now you know why i &apos;m fun at par@@ ties .
when i came out of college , i started to try to do things con@@ tex@@ tu@@ ally in southern california , and you got into the lo@@ gic of span@@ ish col@@ oni@@ al ti@@ le roo@@ fs and things like that .
and if you &apos;re not , you have to pre@@ tend to be slightly bor@@ ed with everything .
phy@@ lli@@ s ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z : we are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friend@@ ship .
these are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; practical jo@@ king with pir@@ ates . &quot;
if you look at rain@@ fall , it was already up 20 percent at that time .
now the first part , the first problem , is relatively easy -- it &apos;s not easy at all -- but it is something that has been approach@@ ed gradu@@ ally in neuro@@ science .
and , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people -- i think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; what is worth living for ? &quot;
so in a program called ta@@ g-@@ a-@@ giant we &apos;ve actually gone from ir@@ eland to canada , from cor@@ si@@ ca to spa@@ in .
they were allowed to return to jer@@ us@@ al@@ em and to re@@ build the temp@@ le .
and there &apos;s stories you tell late at night to a friend , maybe once in your life .
jo@@ han@@ na bla@@ k@@ ley : social media and the end of gender
and for decades , i &apos;m going , why does this happen ? what can i do about it ? how can i change this ? i mean there must be something .
the industry wants to self-@@ police themselves .
i don &apos;t care what you &apos;re doing .
remember , i was being gro@@ om@@ ed to do this . i was not allowed to have jobs .
ben kat@@ ch@@ or : com@@ ics of by@@ gone new york
so i think that &apos;s an important thing to do , and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback , and so@@ lic@@ it it , particularly from friends .
you think that . it &apos;s not true , of course , but that &apos;s the media impres@@ sion , and that &apos;s like what you get .
well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thri@@ ll@@ ing .
75 percent of americans think al@@ as@@ ka is part of canada .
and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum -- if i was a museum cur@@ ator , i would make a room for love , a room for gener@@ osity .
if i separate them again , i have some light .
i &apos;m sorry to say that .
green or natural bu@@ ri@@ als , which don &apos;t use em@@ bal@@ ming , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t address the exi@@ sting tox@@ ins in our bodies .
and you sh@@ red the can@@ di@@ date list .
you pick it up , you put the dam@@ n thing back on , and finish the go@@ d@@ dam@@ n race ! &quot;
we dec@@ ei@@ ve to gain advantage and to hi@@ de our we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses .
the lives of people , the wel@@ far@@ es of people , improve dra@@ matically .
and here are two different images of the archi@@ me@@ des man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt .
the last bu@@ car@@ do was a female named ce@@ li@@ a who was still alive , but then they cap@@ tured her , they got a little bit of tissue from her ear , they cr@@ yo@@ preser@@ ved it in liquid ni@@ tro@@ gen , rele@@ ased her back into the wild , but a few months later , she was found dead under a fallen tree .
and instead i wanted to ask , &quot; how are the different task groups inter@@ depen@@ dent ? &quot;
a couple of them were students in a course i was giving on evolutionary biology .
when you get there , this is what you see , and it &apos;s the va@@ st@@ ness of the place which makes you feel hel@@ pl@@ ess and vulnerable .
i &apos;d like to share three sets of examples , starting with adap@@ ting to violent stor@@ ms and f@@ loo@@ ds .
but the problem with capit@@ alism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people , and therefore extreme responsibility , i think , goes with that wealth .
six months after that , with no explan@@ ation , they let me go .
it recently came out that experts tri@@ aling drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , pri@@ mar@@ ily on male animals and then , pri@@ mar@@ ily on men .
and just to sam@@ ple the kind of interven@@ tions that we find have an effect , when we teach people about the pleas@@ ant life , how to have more pleasure in your life , one of your as@@ sign@@ ments is to take the min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness skills , the sa@@ vor@@ ing skills , and you &apos;re as@@ sig@@ ned to design a beautiful day .
now i started this from a point of view that it has to be something that sc@@ ales en masse .
but the beauty of this , too , is we can then dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate it to children .
this takes the temperature of the can@@ al and turns it into this four@@ -@@ degrees of heat exchange .
yeah . just like , you know , like the 10@@ -@@ second version of 10 , 11 and 12 . because we just -- your sli@@ des are so gor@@ ge@@ ous , and the ideas are so big , i can &apos;t stand to let you go down without seeing 10 , 11 and 12 .
we se@@ cu@@ red 20 million dollars to build fir@@ st-@@ phase projects .
it &apos;s constantly mor@@ ph@@ ing and changing the world , like climate change .
i assem@@ bled this team of 29 people from 10 nations .
migr@@ ating e@@ ast@@ ward , following the gras@@ s@@ lands , because that &apos;s what they were adap@@ ted to live on .
this is my harv@@ est , people .
and yet from everything we &apos;ve been talking about -- compli@@ ance , or addi@@ ction , or weight loss -- we now know that community is important , and yet it &apos;s one thing we don &apos;t actually bring in .
dan gil@@ bert pres@@ ents research and data from his exploration of happiness -- sharing some surprising tests and experiments that you can also try on yourself . watch through to the end for a spar@@ kl@@ ing q &amp; amp ; a with some familiar faces .
we are but two thre@@ ads cut from the same cl@@ oth .
how do you le@@ verage that information ?
there &apos;s still a lot to explore .
so in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to kn@@ it .
but main@@ tain@@ ing this her@@ d takes a major toll on our planet .
it &apos;s not really a conscious decision , &quot; i &apos;m going to do this next , i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
being from the mas@@ sach@@ use@@ t@@ ts high-@@ tech community myself , i &apos;d point out that we were hi@@ pp@@ ies also in the 196@@ 0s , although we hung around harvard square .
but only four years after it was built , gu@@ sta@@ ve ei@@ ff@@ el was building the ei@@ ff@@ el to@@ wer , and as he built the ei@@ ff@@ el to@@ wer , he changed the sky@@ lines of the cities of the world , changed and created a competition between places like new york city and chicago , where develop@@ ers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pus@@ hing the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e up higher and higher with better and better engineering .
but even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it &apos;s not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us .
and before you get to change the world , bad things are going to take place .
the ar@@ ro@@ ws indi@@ cate peak gra@@ y matter volu@@ me in pre@@ fron@@ tal cortex . you can see that that peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls , and that &apos;s probably because boys go through pu@@ ber@@ ty a couple of years later than girls on average , and then during ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , there &apos;s a significant dec@@ line in gra@@ y matter volu@@ me in pre@@ fron@@ tal cortex .
it &apos;s the same in the forest . every p@@ ine tree is different .
and i often think that they have the best of all worl@@ ds .
whereas china could get healthy much earlier , because they applied the knowledge of education , nutri@@ tion , and then also benefits of pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and vac@@ cin@@ es and family planning .
it &apos;s about jo@@ ining with others to pur@@ sue moral ideas .
suppose mar@@ ti@@ an scientists came to earth .
he was a chinese sch@@ ol@@ ar who later , in his 6@@ 0s , got a ph@@ .@@ d. in chinese history .
it &apos;s been wid@@ ely her@@ al@@ ded .
back to back is an austr@@ ali@@ an company of people with intellectual dis@@ abilities . i saw their amazing show in new york at the stat@@ en island fer@@ ry ter@@ min@@ al at rus@@ h hour .
and i &apos;ve done this in three parts .
so it turns out that we have up@@ gra@@ ded .
i have a couple of questions .
she li@@ stens , because that &apos;s what people who tell stories do first .
you are now im@@ mor@@ tal .
he once told me -- he looked kind of sad ; he wor@@ ries very much about the ha@@ ves and ha@@ ve-@@ n@@ ots .
there &apos;s actually normal muscle on top of it . see that ?
and now who would you rather be if a ju@@ ic@@ y piece of go@@ ssi@@ p -- not about you -- was spre@@ ading through the network ?
j yeah , we do get a lot of that .
they can grow so big , blo@@ cking all da@@ y@@ light , making it very dark and om@@ in@@ ous standing under them .
i get this cy@@ ni@@ c@@ ism . i get this sense of im@@ possibility .
it &apos;s a very hard process , but it &apos;s a bal@@ let .
i &apos;m suffering from g@@ aller@@ y fa@@ ti@@ gue .
more recently , somebody even 3@@ d-@@ prin@@ ted tho@@ m yor@@ ke &apos;s head , which is a little cre@@ ep@@ y , but pretty cool .
now it took about two weeks of process@@ ing on in@@ tel &apos;s hig@@ he@@ st-@@ end ser@@ vers to make this happen , and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data .
the &quot; j@@ k we@@ d@@ ding &#91; ent@@ r@@ ance &#93; dance &quot; became so popular that n@@ b@@ c par@@ o@@ died it on the seas@@ on fin@@ ale of &quot; the office , &quot; which just goes to show , it &apos;s truly an ecosystem of culture .
inspired by nature -- that &apos;s the theme here .
and that &apos;s essentially what we &apos;re trying to build .
right now we may think of a big , rich country like the u.s. doing this .
but the pro@@ -@@ e@@ .@@ u@@ . sen@@ ti@@ ment in tur@@ key in the past decade has become almost an islam@@ ic cause and suppor@@ ted by the islam@@ ic liber@@ als and the se@@ cular liber@@ als as well , of course .
we valu@@ ed it as the number of se@@ al p@@ el@@ ts we could kill .
o@@ .@@ k. ? radical , not sub@@ tle .
somehow buying a local let@@ tu@@ ce , changing a light bul@@ b , driving the speed li@@ mit , changing your ti@@ r@@ es regul@@ arly , doesn &apos;t seem suff@@ i@@ cient in the face of climate crisis .
and that may be of great , you know , interest to this group , because all of you are talking about groups .
in eco@@ systems , the waste from one organis@@ m becomes the nutri@@ ent for something else in that system .
so why in the world , you might ask , would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for $ 3@@ .@@ 50 an hour , with a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years ?
we think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the mil@@ ky way alone , our galaxy .
and it &apos;s the combin@@ ation of these things that has led me to the ho@@ bby of sound visu@@ alization , and , on occasi@@ on , has led me to play with fire .
the issue was they didn &apos;t know where the sc@@ u@@ d laun@@ chers were .
well , it &apos;s always kind of funny when he comes up and ho@@ vers .
let &apos;s start with the water .
so this just shows that we can double , tri@@ ple , quad@@ ru@@ ple the robot strength by just getting them to team with neighb@@ ors , as you can see here .
i &apos;m sitting on a train .
think of the big brain .
what we see around us is st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing complexity .
organic chemi@@ sts make molecules , very complicated molecules , by ch@@ opp@@ ing up a big molecule into small molecules and rever@@ se engineering .
and yet we may not realize that in a standard se@@ dan , of all the fuel energy you feed into the car , se@@ ven@@ -@@ ei@@ gh@@ ths never gets to the whe@@ els ; it &apos;s lost first in the engine , i@@ d@@ ling at zero miles a gall@@ on , the power train and ac@@ cess@@ ories .
and this is the question : who am i being , that my players &apos; eyes are not sh@@ ining ?
and that stuff , you see , is going to it the other way .
even worse , what if bl@@ aming the ob@@ ese means we &apos;re bl@@ aming the vic@@ ti@@ ms ?
the cloud li@@ f@@ ted , the wind was still , and even the bear showed up .
and i could tell from their mes@@ sages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me .
and surpris@@ ingly , it became a cul@@ t film .
the net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rec@@ tan@@ gle .
i remember sitting there thinking , this is fantastic .
and so what i &apos;m going to do is , not so much give you the great hits of that program , as to give you this whole notion of how you en@@ counter people in that kind of situation , what you try to find out about them , and when people deliver and when they don &apos;t and why .
we made it thin@@ ner .
and it faces into a park .
can we go with two degrees , three degrees , or -- where we &apos;re currently going -- four degrees cel@@ si@@ us ? &quot;
what i &apos;m running here is a system that en@@ ables me to run a@@ ge-@@ old programs on a modern computer .
my father was kind of like and@@ y gro@@ ve , par@@ an@@ o@@ id of the competition .
no , no , i haven &apos;t got it .
they would take a ship down to pan@@ ama , across the is@@ th@@ mus , and then take another ship north .
and i go to see a famous ma@@ gi@@ cian and pr@@ ou@@ dly ask him , &quot; well what do you think ? &quot;
as people felt less and less free , they also felt less and less provi@@ ded for .
you could use it in an industrial context .
now you see again , this person has re@@ je@@ cted going beyond the con@@ cre@@ te world and analy@@ zing it through everyday experience , and it was important to that person what color be@@ ars were -- that is , they had to h@@ unt be@@ ars .
it &apos;s just the va@@ st@@ ness of space makes it look like nothing &apos;s happening .
well if that &apos;s true , a couple other things had to be true as well .
each ligh@@ t@@ ning bol@@ t he@@ ats the air to 4@@ 4@@ ,000 degrees fahr@@ enheit -- hot@@ ter than the surface of the sun .
and bar@@ on-@@ co@@ hen expla@@ ined that certain dis@@ abilities can mani@@ fest themselves in the ha@@ cking and computing world as tremendous skills , and that we should not be thro@@ wing in ja@@ il people who have such dis@@ abilities and skills because they have lost their way so@@ cially or been du@@ ped .
you see it already . immediately you go in , the refle@@ ctive symme@@ try in the water .
in two weeks , they found him .
because the small ha@@ dr@@ on colli@@ der once was the big thing .
and so the wi@@ ki books project is an effort to do that .
to de@@ fe@@ at our policy of contain@@ ment , not about ide@@ ology .
this is going to show you , real time , an assem@@ bl@@ er . it &apos;s a circu@@ it break@@ er .
and so with many priv@@ acy pro@@ visi@@ ons put in place to protect everyone who was recor@@ ded in the data , we made elements of the data available to my tru@@ sted research team at mit so we could start te@@ asing apart patterns in this massive data set , trying to understand the influence of social environments on language ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion .
and all this admini@@ stra@@ tive data can be pulled together and process@@ ed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before .
what ted cele@@ br@@ ates is the gift of the human imagination .
now in arab@@ ic , we can make this defini@@ te by ad@@ ding the defini@@ te article &quot; al . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to do everything very g@@ ently .
one , they have a lot of sexual priv@@ acy .
but throughout even the worst times of their ent@@ ang@@ le@@ ment , all sides have reach@@ ed out to each other .
so suddenly we had this area that we were prote@@ cting , but now it appe@@ ared to be dead , at least in the coral areas .
i like to believe it was because i was a good listen@@ er .
i have no idea how it works , but i paid a lot of money for it .
kan@@ z@@ i &apos;s rock is from gon@@ a , ethi@@ op@@ ia and is iden@@ tical to that used by our african ancestors two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half million years ago .
you &apos;re going to be able to power stuff , so ir@@ ri@@ gation makes a difference .
now , i was saying , well , that &apos;s the whole point : it &apos;s moving .
you &apos;re up all night . you &apos;re walking ti@@ ll da@@ wn .
well , it turns out that the 7@@ 3@@ 7 top sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders have the potential to colle@@ c@@ tively control 80 percent of the t@@ n@@ cs &apos; value .
so i started to look at passion , i started to look at efficiency versus effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess -- as tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distin@@ ction .
it &apos;s not to create a technologi@@ cal solution , it &apos;s to se@@ du@@ ce you into something that you can do , into something that will please you , something that will li@@ ft your spi@@ ri@@ ts , something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his no@@ b@@ u restaurant in new york , which is supposed to take you from the clu@@ tter of new york city to the simpli@@ city of japan and the elegan@@ ce of japanese tradition .
there will be massive amo@@ unts of data flo@@ wing as@@ hor@@ e , all available to anyone who has any interest in using it .
the first stage in a technology &apos;s ad@@ v@@ ance is that it &apos;ll fall below a critical price .
that was the pa@@ ige typ@@ es@@ et@@ ter .
so it is better , it is sa@@ fer ; it is aff@@ ord@@ able , it is energ@@ y-@@ efficient .
if someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it , don &apos;t just take them at their word .
it actually le@@ ap@@ s into the air , and has a@@ er@@ ial ph@@ ases when it does it , like a horse , and you &apos;ll see it &apos;s boun@@ cing here .
this was another newspaper image .
and as i li@@ f@@ ted my leg out of bed , she reach@@ ed for my cru@@ t@@ ches and hand@@ ed them to me .
i &apos;m allo@@ wing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos , i &apos;m hop@@ ing some moments of truth will come .
and that &apos;s basically what &apos;s going on in your brain right now as you &apos;re watching this .
and so , it &apos;s like , good news or bad news ?
now , 198@@ 6 .
so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have , what the chan@@ ces are that they &apos;re willing to take , what they &apos;re after , what they value , what they want , and what they believe about other people .
ai@@ d@@ g has worked in haiti since 2007 , provi@@ ding engineering and business support to small businesses .
she &apos;s eight years old , and she li@@ kes robots , too .
and if you had an in@@ ju@@ red organ , if you had a heart attack and we wanted to re@@ pair that in@@ ju@@ red area , do you want those rob@@ ust , pl@@ enti@@ ful stem cells on the top ?
yet , the ice of ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a is a cal@@ end@@ ar of climate change .
let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
and in fact , they say she deser@@ ves more bl@@ ame in this case , the failed attemp@@ t to har@@ m , than in another case , which we call an accident .
it &apos;s now more than 8@@ 2 percent .
this is not local population , this is re@@ bel@@ s .
the discussion is all about images on the computer , data .
when it hit that dete@@ ctor is depen@@ dent on the mass and the charge .
so he had a hand@@ ful of sh@@ ri@@ mp , maybe seven or eight sh@@ ri@@ mp , and all those other animals on the de@@ ck of the boat are by@@ catch .
or , even better , let &apos;s just take people right out of the emergen@@ cy room -- un@@ defined , commun@@ it@@ y-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red res@@ pir@@ atory tra@@ ct infe@@ ctions .
although growth has certainly deli@@ vered many benefits , it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around .
the micro@@ bes on your skin can help boo@@ st your imm@@ une system .
i &apos;m rich bar@@ ani@@ u@@ k .
and it &apos;s trying to show off its ability : &quot; i &apos;m mach@@ o , i &apos;m strong .
and i said , &quot; this just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;ll sound cor@@ ny , but it &apos;s sin@@ c@@ ere .
em : i mean , you can certainly drive -- if you drive it 65 miles an hour , under normal conditions , 250 miles is a reas@@ on@@ able number .
i became an under@@ water photograph@@ er because i fell in love with the sea , and i make pictures of it today because i want to protect it , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s too late .
1,@@ 8@@ 60 -- am i good ?
because in reality , our biggest challenge are the soli@@ d organs .
to me , this obs@@ ession is the source and ro@@ ot of all of our produ@@ c@@ tivity and creativity .
we are ben@@ ding the cur@@ ve .
your brand is what other people say about you when you &apos;re not in the room , the saying goes .
so this requires fig@@ uring out how to get the most out of something &apos;s in@@ na@@ te properties and also how to b@@ end it to my will .
so this was an end@@ less cycle of them building and us destro@@ ying in front of their eyes .
and they asked them to inno@@ v@@ ate and create the next big product for this company .
here it &apos;s already at the third sam@@ ple .
that &apos;s all the euro@@ tr@@ ash coming through j@@ f@@ k cu@@ st@@ oms .
that &apos;s just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculp@@ ture .
l@@ z gr@@ ander@@ son : the my@@ th of the gay agenda
what dri@@ ves the dis@@ ability for these dis@@ orders like schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ pol@@ ar and depression ?
and for the most part try to stop them from making this argument .
despite the advanced technology , it &apos;s not reach@@ ing the people who need it most .
and , in fact , everybody &apos;s li@@ sted twice , because it &apos;s sor@@ ted once by name and once by email address .
now , i also happen to be gay .
in change and development and growth .
and i just want to mention brie@@ fly in pas@@ sing -- i &apos;m past my time li@@ mit -- but i just want to brie@@ fly mention in pas@@ sing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is , at a similar meeting , back in the spring , an@@ ne wo@@ j@@ ci@@ ck@@ i heard about our story and very quickly -- in a sp@@ an of three weeks -- put the full resources of 2@@ 3@@ and@@ me , and we announ@@ ced an initiative in ju@@ ly to get to de@@ code the genome of anybody , a living person with a heart tissue , bone sar@@ com@@ a .
so put your arms back up and fle@@ x your bi@@ ce@@ p .
there are , in fact , a lot of cor@@ rela@@ tions between the two forms of music i think in different time peri@@ ods .
and that &apos;s , of course , what this is about .
je@@ an-@@ mich@@ el bas@@ qui@@ at , important to me because &#91; he was &#93; the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what i was about to enter into .
and even those people who com@@ pla@@ in and say that the relative standing of countries on something like p@@ is@@ a is just an arti@@ fact of culture , of economic fac@@ tors , of social issues , of hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty of societies , and so on , these people must now con@@ ce@@ de that education impro@@ vement is possible .
they were all on the gul@@ f in may , while oil was starting to come as@@ hor@@ e in certain places .
and of course there is rule number nine .
and i think that we need to be more aware of , and we need to find the ris@@ k-@@ benefit ra@@ ti@@ o .
the very first year , starting when g@@ ag@@ ar@@ in went in space , and a few weeks later al@@ an she@@ pher@@ d , there were five man@@ ned space fli@@ ghts in the world -- the very first year .
we need to emplo@@ y technology to as@@ s@@ ist us in this qu@@ est .
the environment is impli@@ cated , radi@@ cally impli@@ cated , right .
we tend to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate spec@@ tac@@ ular and rare risks and down@@ play common risks -- so flying versus driving .
the desert is there , sand dun@@ es , some small field .
for me , the world is ve@@ ering towards a future we don &apos;t much want when we really think about it deep inside .
g@@ ho@@ sts , right ?
and then we went to a fish restaurant , and we had ch@@ ad , the sur@@ fer du@@ de , ser@@ ving us , and he came up and my mother said , &quot; do you have any speci@@ als , young man ? &quot;
s@@ b : yes ! somebody got it .
so for example , they name the colle@@ ction from microsoft started on september 11 , 2007 , for y@@ a@@ ho@@ o on the mar@@ ch 12 , 2008 , and then others : google , facebook , sk@@ yp@@ e , apple and so on .
i cher@@ ish the future .
thank you .
it pul@@ ls me . it turns . i throw my hand up . i &apos;m able to gra@@ b a bran@@ ch .
the optimis@@ m bi@@ as has been obser@@ ved in many different countries -- in western cultures , in non-@@ western cultures , in fe@@ males and males , in kids , in the el@@ der@@ ly .
the tools of social net@@ working , these are the digital cam@@ p@@ fir@@ es around which the audience ga@@ thers to hear our story .
we don &apos;t ever want to do that actually . we want to be inside the universe because there &apos;s no such thing as standing outside the universe .
in this case , a one-@@ centi@@ meter tumor .

and this pro@@ pos@@ al was a reaction to the over@@ -@@ sat@@ u@@ ration of emer@@ gent technologies in recent national and world ex@@ posi@@ tions , which fe@@ e@@ ds , or has been fe@@ eding , our in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able appe@@ ti@@ te for visual stimu@@ lation with an ever greater digital virtu@@ osity .

and remember , one to@@ we@@ l per person for one year -- 5@@ 7@@ 1,@@ 2@@ 3@@ 0,000 pounds of paper . no small thing .
and then i go out , and they work on me for the rest of the night , and i needed about 40 un@@ its of blood to keep me there while they did their work , and the surge@@ on took out about a third of my inte@@ st@@ ines , my ce@@ c@@ um , organs i didn &apos;t know that i had , and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to re@@ move my app@@ en@@ di@@ x for me , which i thought was great , you know , just a little ti@@ dy thing there at the end .
and he had his arm out@@ stre@@ t@@ ched like someone out of the app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce .
every day he leaves the wire with a mission .
they had understood that their role with my@@ bo@@ .com was to conven@@ e their suppor@@ ters but not to control their suppor@@ ters .
so , normally i would start at 3@@ 8 be@@ ats per minute , and while holding my breath it would drop to 12 be@@ ats per minute , which is pretty unusual .
to answer this question , we can phr@@ ase another question .
the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws are doing this , the eyes are de@@ focused , and the mouth is han@@ ging open .
du@@ mas mal@@ one was from miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i origin@@ ally .

i read &quot; peter and the wol@@ f &quot; with this beautiful band from ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard .
and it gives you that c@@ lar@@ ity of perspective of , man , i &apos;m just me , and popul@@ ar@@ ity , what does that really mean again ? not much .
now looking back on the w@@ re@@ ck@@ age and des@@ pair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
so i looked at the cul@@ tiv@@ ation of information as if it were food and said , so we were h@@ unter@@ -@@ ga@@ thers of information .
and it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
it &apos;s a robot that has three legs , which is inspired by nature .
maybe it &apos;s because dad used to read to us at night .

why ? because they were old and in@@ fir@@ m , and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything .
and inside there &apos;s nothing ; there &apos;s no famous actor &apos;s voice ; there &apos;s no proje@@ ctions ; there &apos;s no telev@@ isi@@ ons ; there &apos;s no color changing .
my mom says , &quot; pro@@ test mar@@ ch . &quot;
it might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
you can feel your body .
we establi@@ shed a green ta@@ x , and then everybody accep@@ ted it and all busin@@ ess@@ men paid it regul@@ arly .
now , researchers have actually measu@@ red whi@@ st@@ le complexity using information theory , and whi@@ st@@ les rate very high relative to even human languages .
and there i was cr@@ ying away , and s@@ mas@@ h , bas@@ h on my rock .
third thing is , i ad@@ ded up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years , and i gave it back .
and since i &apos;m reali@@ stic , rather than gran@@ dio@@ se , i don &apos;t cla@@ im that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once un@@ ra@@ vel all its myster@@ ies .
and they trained 5@@ 0,000 bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers on how to use them -- long exten@@ sive , mon@@ th@@ s-@@ long training s@@ essi@@ ons -- because these things are essentially anal@@ o@@ g computers ; they &apos;re not easy to use .
and to do that , i &apos;m going to tell you about a frame@@ work which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years called ba@@ y@@ es@@ ian decision theory .
so i come up , and i say , &quot; what am i going to do today ? &quot; i &apos;m not going to do what i plan@@ ned to do , and i put myself into absolute pan@@ ic .
when you &apos;re in the low-@@ power pose condition , only 60 percent , and that &apos;s a pretty wh@@ opp@@ ing significant difference .
we found this le@@ op@@ ard in a 2,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year-old ba@@ ob@@ ab tree in africa , the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother .
not &quot; a dic@@ tion@@ ary , &quot; or &quot; dic@@ tion@@ aries . &quot; and that &apos;s because , well , people use the dic@@ tion@@ ary to stand for the whole language .
but i &apos;m more excited that you can actually take it outside .
almost everything kids do is art .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
silk , during its self-@@ assem@@ bly process , acts like a co@@ co@@ on for biological matter .
joe : no . ar : no , it &apos;s not here . open your hand .
is it going to land where it &apos;s supposed to ?
the thing that sti@@ cks with me the most is that he was apo@@ logi@@ zing to me for cr@@ ying in front of me , and at the same time , he was also giving me pro@@ ps , li@@ f@@ ting me up , for not cr@@ ying .
now , i &apos;m going to show you the beginn@@ ings of a piece that is about balance in some ways , and also -- oh , actually , if you &apos;re bor@@ ed , not here , here &apos;s one use for it .
you know , co@@ yo@@ te in central park , a wh@@ ale in the go@@ wan@@ us can@@ al , el@@ k in west@@ che@@ ster coun@@ ty .
but sometimes i see this in@@ geni@@ ous idea in there , and i have this eu@@ re@@ ka moment .
until the only things that you have left are these cells here , the out@@ put cells , the ones that send the signals to the brain , but because of all that de@@ generation they aren &apos;t sending any signals anymore .
and sometimes things are okay .
his name was john bel@@ k . some of you will probably know him .
but as we &apos;ve seen over the last year , i think that &apos;s an idea that is increasingly coming into question .
these are really hy@@ bri@@ ds , not p@@ ure animals .
a second option is the sex@@ y ge@@ ek option .
it was made by a russi@@ an that &apos;s designed most of the su@@ its of the past 18 years for the so@@ vie@@ ts .
that need for animal protein is going to continue .
the device could be implan@@ ted under the sc@@ al@@ p to be totally hidden and avoid wire break@@ age , which occur@@ s if you put it in the ch@@ est and you try to move your ne@@ ck around .
now , what i &apos;m going to be looking for in this test is how it prote@@ cts your li@@ ps , the tex@@ ture , right , and maybe if you can disc@@ ern any fla@@ vor or not .
there &apos;s a growing number of online resources that are de@@ dic@@ ated to just expla@@ ining science in simple , under@@ stand@@ able ways .
we &apos;re able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity , that recy@@ cle much of their water , that are much more comfortable than standard buildings , use all@@ -@@ natural light , etc . , and , over time , cost less .
she bel@@ on@@ gs to the species known as austr@@ al@@ op@@ i@@ the@@ c@@ us af@@ ar@@ en@@ sis .
like most journ@@ alists , i &apos;m an ide@@ alist .

it needs to be rock@@ et@@ -@@ powered or one of these things , a great big gas ballo@@ on .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it &apos;s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
this is cu@@ ev@@ a de v@@ ill@@ a lu@@ z in tab@@ as@@ co , in mexico , and this ca@@ ve is satur@@ ated with su@@ l@@ fu@@ ric ac@@ id .
and if we han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves with play , we han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves as if we would with any other birth@@ right that we have .
if they can &apos;t intern@@ alize it , they won &apos;t trust it .
the descri@@ ption perfectly cap@@ tured ed@@ wards &apos; personal van@@ ity .
the la@@ ke is entirely fro@@ zen .
well now there &apos;s essentially a virtual col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y .
and so it is not any one stri@@ pe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here ; it &apos;s the bar@@ code that in bul@@ k represents the whole thing .
one key difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far i &apos;ve only spe@@ cul@@ ated on the possibility that there might be other univer@@ ses .
first , i want to start by saying , this is a boy , and this is a girl , and this is probably stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ically what you think of as a boy and a girl .
18 more months .
first , leadership .
music tran@@ sc@@ ends the a@@ es@@ thetic beauty alone .
and that actually helped a lot .
this is a song that was recor@@ ded there .
these individuals are at specific risk , particularly if there &apos;s blood contact , they &apos;re at risk for trans@@ mission and possibly infe@@ ction with novel viruses .
my sister and i started this project in 2005 because in that year , at least in the science press , there was a lot of talk about global warming , and the effect that global warming was having on coral re@@ ef@@ s .
it was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surge@@ ons who knew what to do with their hands .
and i recently made a film called &quot; the budd@@ h@@ ist science of the mind . &quot;
and by night , artificial light in each one e@@ man@@ ates and comes out to the outside .
we have each other .
when we first went out to talk to people in fac@@ tor@@ ies about how we could get robots to interact with them better , one of the questions we asked them was , &quot; do you want your children to work in a factory ? &quot;
it should be done by fun . gener@@ osity is more fun . that &apos;s the key .
but this technology could not find tumor@@ s when they &apos;re small , and finding a small tumor is critical for survival .
by invisible , i mean it doesn &apos;t absor@@ b in the electro@@ magnetic spectrum .
and i took that driving lesson , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to learn how to drive . &quot;
so here &apos;s the thing : the current business model for language education is the student pa@@ ys , and in particular , the student pa@@ ys ro@@ sett@@ a stone 500 dollars .
so these are fantastic images .
and by the way he con@@ vi@@ cted me as a pl@@ under@@ er of the earth .
so within that context , there &apos;s two theor@@ ies of the case as to why we &apos;re all here .
so what i &apos;m showing you , from left to right , is how much activity there was in this brain region , and from top to bottom , how much bl@@ ame people said that gra@@ ce deser@@ ved .
you had a re@@ bel@@ li@@ on in the north , the government in the south -- the capital , ab@@ i@@ d@@ j@@ an -- and in the middle , the french army .
and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution , we need to not just take our hands in in new ways , we also need to take our eyes in in new ways .
so , all of these projects have a human@@ i@@ stic sense to them , and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it &apos;s for business , or , as i &apos;m going to show , on some ci@@ vic@@ -@@ type projects .
you had cent@@ r@@ alized energy production .
re : wait . i have one more thing to add .
conser@@ vation &apos;s tou@@ g@@ her , but we can probably get there .
it is prin@@ ting . you put that on , you warm it a little bit , the wa@@ x prin@@ ts through so it absor@@ bs into the paper , and you end up with the device that you want .
it &apos;s the only machine in the world that &apos;s actually done fusion .
but i &apos;m the ol@@ dest six@@ th gra@@ der you &apos;ll ever meet , so i get up every day with this tremendous amount of enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m that i &apos;m hop@@ ing to share with you all today .
until they identify this case , we &apos;ll never rele@@ ase him .
this is about consum@@ ers working together to get what they want out of the market@@ place .
politics is not just about leaders .
and again , there &apos;s a val@@ id test of what your five highest streng@@ ths are .
and we think this is speci@@ es@@ -@@ specific , which means that that could explain why we can &apos;t communicate across species .
so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predat@@ ors are .
today i want to talk to you about swi@@ mming across the north pole , across the most northern place in the whole world .
when you look at this or@@ b web , you &apos;re actually seeing many types of silk fi@@ bers .
and he dri@@ ves a very nice car .
i just tou@@ ched his back , and i just tou@@ ched his arm .
this isn &apos;t photo@@ sh@@ opp@@ ed .
he asked the question , if i take that material , which is a natural material that usually indu@@ ces heal@@ ing in the small inte@@ st@@ ine , and i place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tis@@ su@@ e-@@ specific response , or would it make small inte@@ st@@ ine if i tried to make a new ear ?
so let me talk about hydro@@ gen first .
college presi@@ dents are not the first people who come to mind when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination .
they connect dis@@ par@@ ate information , and they bring it together in a way that a security analy@@ st doesn &apos;t expect . right ?
and there were times when i was actually so des@@ per@@ ate i would just , you know , walk into a room and just go like , &quot; eric ! &quot;
ben@@ o@@ it has been particularly interested in ne@@ sted patterns , in fra@@ ct@@ als and so on , where the structure is something that &apos;s kind of tre@@ e-@@ like , and where there &apos;s sort of a big bran@@ ch that makes little bran@@ ches and even smaller bran@@ ches and so on .
though i &apos;ll probably also say something about her hair and person@@ ality as well .
if i make the fla@@ p as sk@@ inn@@ y as possible , i get to the li@@ mit of the minim@@ um amount of paper needed .
see , so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is .
i &apos;m here .
so , there are many , many more children who need to be treated , and in order to exp@@ and the scop@@ e of the project , we are planning on laun@@ ching the pra@@ k@@ ash center for children , which will have a de@@ dic@@ ated pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric hospital , a school for the children we are tre@@ ating and also a cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge research facili@@ ty .
all this really surprised me , because i started to realize that my un@@ si@@ gh@@ ted experienced was so far more multi-@@ sensor@@ y than my si@@ gh@@ ted experience ever was .
okay . i am known as cap@@ tain organic , and that &apos;s a philosop@@ hi@@ cal position as well as an a@@ es@@ thetic position .
these bub@@ bles are made from natural c@@ ot@@ ton and ru@@ b@@ ber from the ru@@ b@@ ber tree .
i sub@@ mit that the intelligence of a lan@@ c@@ et flu@@ ke is down there somewhere between pe@@ t@@ uni@@ a and car@@ rot .
thank you . thank you .
as soon as he got to the lab , even though he was the yo@@ un@@ gest , he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of for@@ ged docum@@ ents .
your body doesn &apos;t like the sal@@ t@@ water .
you know , there &apos;s a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing , passion in life , and foc@@ using all your energy on it , and i &apos;ve never been able to do that .
and i &apos;ll leave you with this story , which i think cap@@ tures a lot of these values , and it &apos;s just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in un@@ likely ways .
then here come the marke@@ te@@ ers and the ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ers .
so i want to show you one pres@@ cri@@ ption product in the clin@@ ic called the no park .
the engineers have done a phenomen@@ al amount of innovation on this part , and battery life on this product is now 15 hours -- just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they &apos;re passionate and motiv@@ ated to be able to do this .
hy@@ un@@ -@@ so@@ ok sta@@ yed at father ke@@ ene &apos;s , and her un@@ cle agre@@ ed to let her stay there until the adop@@ tion went through .
so that &apos;s a tough challenge , right ?
this is , of course , unless your whole life is about being sec@@ ure .
and i was standing just anony@@ m@@ ously in a swe@@ at@@ shir@@ t , putting my hand on and off of a tr@@ as@@ h@@ can to signal the advan@@ c@@ ement .
a bat &apos;s a pen@@ is , and a na@@ pp@@ y du@@ g@@ out is a vul@@ va , or a vagina .
com@@ pos@@ er and conduc@@ tor eric whit@@ ac@@ re has inspired millions by bringing together &quot; virtual cho@@ irs , &quot; sing@@ ers from many countries spli@@ ced together on video . now , for the first time ever , he creates the experience in real time , as 32 sing@@ ers from around the world sk@@ yp@@ e in to join an on@@ stage cho@@ ir for an epi@@ c performance of whit@@ ac@@ re &apos;s &quot; clou@@ d@@ bur@@ st , &quot; based on a po@@ em by oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o pa@@ z .
and so tex@@ ting actually is evidence of a bal@@ an@@ cing act that young people are using today , not consci@@ ously , of course , but it &apos;s an expan@@ sion of their l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
both songs have something in common : that same appe@@ al of celebra@@ tion and unity .
one third of it , in fact , is genetic .
they rely very hea@@ vi@@ ly on teachers , who i have personally seen di@@ stor@@ t the message to these children as and when it su@@ its their purpose to .
but he made me feel i was telling him a fab@@ ul@@ ous story .
this may be the year we er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate polio -- that will make it the second disease in history .
so i am a surge@@ on who studies creativity , and i have never had a patient tell me that &quot; i really want you to be creative during surgery , &quot; and so i guess there &apos;s a little bit of ir@@ ony to it .
is it just about a lack of education ?
in fact , people were extremely fru@@ strated .
so my question is , if it can be done in europe , why not in the middle east ?
there is y@@ ves ro@@ ss@@ y .
it &apos;s ol@@ d-@@ school demo@@ graphi@@ cs .
and that &apos;s where all the bee@@ kee@@ pers come after a night of moving bees into the al@@ mond gro@@ ves .
i do run a kind of a business -- i &apos;ve got 120 people and you &apos;ve got to pay them , so there &apos;s a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with , i think , a healthy inse@@ curity .
because we want this to be difficult , and i &apos;ll tell you why moment@@ arily .
there &apos;s rand@@ y , these guys are pas@@ sing a ru@@ b@@ ber little pu@@ ck between them .
i &apos;m talking about men with young minds , of course .
but what politicians need is a range of op@@ tions .
and then at college , it &apos;s like she never came home .
so einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theor@@ ies and came up with theor@@ ies and then came up with his equ@@ ations .
and then it &apos;s never good enough .
i &apos;ve failed them .
and the effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of a group is not determin@@ ed by the i@@ q of the group ; it &apos;s determin@@ ed by how well they communicate , how often they take turns in conversation .
and i &apos;m also trying to have some me@@ als , and have some s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks , and , you know , and y@@ ell at my children , and do all the normal things that keep you gro@@ unded .
i ought to explain that i have no idea what was happening at the time .
it depen@@ ded on the shape of their sk@@ ul@@ l , though , so we had to actually get those measu@@ re@@ ments to be sure that we had re@@ constru@@ cted and could prove to the scientific world that super@@ cro@@ c in fact is a 4@@ 0-@@ foot cro@@ co@@ di@@ le , probably a male .
they would not take the hypo@@ the@@ tical seriously , and without the hypo@@ the@@ tical , it &apos;s very difficult to get moral argument off the ground .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no ade@@ qu@@ ate san@@ it@@ ation .
and he expla@@ ined that they have done this proce@@ d@@ ure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing .
so i would say , &quot; ale@@ x , i know that it &apos;s terri@@ bly difficult .
central among them , a commit@@ ment to ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful means .
it also gave the u.s. mon@@ et@@ ary auth@@ ori@@ ties the right to monit@@ or any dollar trans@@ action taking place anywhere in the world .
they said , &quot; what ? you &apos;re still being too dam@@ n pi@@ cky . &quot;
i don &apos;t like beautiful buildings built for tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian regi@@ mes .
i can wear it around .
two new kinds of wh@@ ales have been discovered , along with two new an@@ tel@@ op@@ es , do@@ zens of mon@@ key species and a new kind of eleph@@ ant -- and even a distin@@ ct kind of gor@@ ill@@ a .
but my subject is national security .
it &apos;s similar to other nutri@@ tional diseases .
most online clas@@ ses , the videos are always available .
they ask us to use them only against the in@@ fi@@ d@@ els .
we think in narra@@ tive structures .
stem cell@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved re@@ tin@@ al transplan@@ ts , now in a research phase , may one day re@@ store vision , or part vision , to millions of patients with re@@ tin@@ al diseases worldwide .
or might we be able to le@@ verage today &apos;s gam@@ ing technology , like the microsoft kin@@ e@@ ct , and ha@@ ck that to en@@ able diagno@@ stics , for example , in diagno@@ sing stro@@ ke , using simple motion dete@@ ction , using hundre@@ d-@@ dollar devices .
i had fun .
but what i found is it &apos;s in the people and how they use it that , to me , makes it so special .
i started making pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts when i was a kid .
but there &apos;s a far worse dan@@ ger con@@ fron@@ ting us .
so i created the place sam@@ bo@@ ja le@@ star@@ i , and the idea was , if i can do this on the worst possible place that i can think of where there is really nothing left , no one will have an exc@@ use to say , &quot; yeah , but ... &quot;
so just a month ago , on janu@@ ary 2@@ 9@@ th , we un@@ v@@ ei@@ led this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the worl@@ d-@@ famous da@@ y@@ ton@@ a international spe@@ ed@@ way during the ro@@ le@@ x 24 ra@@ cing event .
your b@@ ones re@@ generate every 10 years .
i very much rel@@ ate to this idea of god .
and those are those ca@@ st-@@ ir@@ on things you see at anti@@ que sh@@ ops .
we also , like a lot of companies , create a product that &apos;s based on technology trends .
all of these solutions der@@ i@@ ve their orig@@ ins from the text of the book , but once the book designer has read the text , then he has to be an interpre@@ ter and a transl@@ ator .
the arri@@ val of countries like china and india -- between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population -- and others like in@@ don@@ es@@ ia and brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democra@@ ti@@ zation in the last 200 years .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 3@@ 50 , 400 uses .
so race , class , gender , ability , all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman .
actually , those action video game players have many other advan@@ tages in terms of attention , and one aspe@@ ct of attention which is also impro@@ ved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world .
in this eng@@ aging talk , world cham@@ pi@@ on whi@@ st@@ ler ge@@ ert ch@@ at@@ ro@@ u per@@ forms the wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal &quot; ele@@ on@@ or@@ a &quot; by a. hon@@ ho@@ ff , and his own &quot; f@@ ê@@ te de la b@@ elle . &quot; in a fascinating inter@@ lu@@ de , he talks about what brought him to the craft . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and that &apos;s the world i really want to live in .
so now , several hundred of these walking meetings later , i &apos;ve learned a few things .
or in uganda , &quot; name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that . &quot;
other women became mad , driven machines like me .
and he lost his lower ja@@ w , his li@@ p , his ch@@ in and his upp@@ er ja@@ w and teeth .
and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; but , ai@@ mee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot;
and then the third key actor is the post-@@ conflict government .
professor to@@ bi@@ as came over from south africa and spoke to university college london .
why would a man assu@@ me that you would believe something bizar@@ re like this ?
let &apos;s figure out how long it takes a ra@@ ce@@ car to go a certain distance .
n@@ m : well , we &apos;re gon@@ na play one together now .
i &apos;ve got another wal@@ -@@ m@@ art story for you , ok ?
okay , so when that happens everything lines up .
so i start as a baby , and then if you pun@@ ch the clock , you &apos;ll actually transform the baby into a to@@ dd@@ ler , and then from a to@@ dd@@ ler i &apos;m trans@@ formed into a teenager .
can you make something from nothing as a sculp@@ tor ? &quot;
and yet when i think of the poverty of society which doesn &apos;t give freedom to its people , i don &apos;t ad@@ mi@@ re those buildings .
there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine , and one way is to extra@@ ct human dna from ancient b@@ ones .
i remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same hei@@ ght .
now when we looked at the easy origami , we saw the same thing : buil@@ ders loved it more , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ators loved it less .
what do you think of fo@@ ie gras that 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 99 percent of the world e@@ ats ?
the co-@@ pilot was a lady called mon@@ ic@@ a .
if you look at dis@@ ability , as measu@@ red by the world health organization with something they call the dis@@ ability ad@@ ju@@ sted life years , it &apos;s kind of a me@@ tri@@ c that nobody would think of except an econom@@ ist , except it &apos;s one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of dis@@ ability from medical causes , and as you can see , virtu@@ ally 30 percent of all dis@@ ability from all medical causes can be at@@ tribu@@ ted to mental dis@@ orders , neu@@ rop@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric syndro@@ mes .
it makes the brain in@@ her@@ ently rob@@ ust .
that &apos;s the focus of the field research , the centers that we &apos;ve set up all over the world -- 10 of them , top population gene@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts .
uns@@ us@@ pe@@ cting gu@@ ests were ser@@ ved ste@@ wed tur@@ n-@@ of-@@ the-@@ century tur@@ k@@ ish fi@@ gs for break@@ fast .
raise your right hand . ok . how many of you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about ? raise your left hand .
it &apos;s common among a privi@@ le@@ ged class capable of paying nu@@ mer@@ ous do@@ wri@@ es and keeping multiple homes .
they &apos;re able to go out and consi@@ st@@ ently do this , pus@@ hing the car to the limit@@ s every single time .
imagine the middle east without oil income , but with collap@@ sing governments .
this could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet earth .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why the entrop@@ y was ever low in the first place .
the electro@@ magnetic and we@@ ak forces interact with matter according to their hyper@@ charge and we@@ ak charge , which make this pattern .
what you &apos;re doing is , when you stand up , potential energy to kin@@ e@@ tic energy , potential energy to kin@@ e@@ tic energy .
and you put a little fan here .
there is a picture of charles . so let &apos;s watch the next clip .
it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in 50 minutes , i might sc@@ ore an f .
and especially the young people were coming . and were asking me -- the young people were saying , &quot; what can we do ? what can we do to change things ? &quot;
that trend is generally called islam@@ ic moder@@ nis@@ m , and it was advanced by intellec@@ tu@@ als and stat@@ es@@ men , not just as an intellectual idea though , but also as a political program .
but the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demon@@ strate mistakes .
photograph@@ er ni@@ ck ni@@ ch@@ ols went to docum@@ ent a very small and relatively un@@ known wild@@ life san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in ch@@ ad , called z@@ ak@@ ou@@ ma .
simil@@ arly , here &apos;s a mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional medical device manufac@@ tur@@ er .
and they &apos;ll put their fin@@ s out and their eyes go in the back of their head , and the fish come up and they just clean , clean , clean -- because the mol@@ as , you know , there &apos;s just a s@@ mor@@ gas@@ bor@@ d of par@@ as@@ ites .
again , all of this is done in the way us humans do things , and that &apos;s cru@@ cially important if we want mil@@ o to appear real .
so who &apos;s the man now ? &quot; he asked them .
one out of four south bronx children has as@@ th@@ ma .
it was written for an amazing sing@@ er called ca@@ thy ber@@ beri@@ an .
so what &apos;s a good definition for cy@@ bor@@ g ?
and this is something that we should really work on , which is africa , which is just a few tri@@ ck@@ les , basically in south africa and a few other urban cities .
that &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
sex !
the goal is to get the red car out . it &apos;s a sli@@ ding block puzz@@ le .
when pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an and isra@@ el@@ i politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an re@@ a@@ der still re@@ ads a novel by a je@@ wish auth@@ or , and vice ver@@ sa , conne@@ cting and em@@ pa@@ thi@@ zing with the nar@@ r@@ ator .
and , anyway , the next morning we had to go along to the je@@ wel@@ er and get it cut off .
so this is just a picture -- a micro@@ graph of your skin .
well without thinking , i told him &quot; come tomorrow .

you see , babies are born in a state of u@@ tter fra@@ gi@@ li@@ ty .
for all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change .
why is that ?
and it turns out , from our research , that it bo@@ ils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones .
they have fan@@ cy models of attention , pos@@ ner &apos;s trin@@ ity model of attention .
that &apos;s one thing you americans take for gran@@ ted , you know ?
so what actually happened ?
so the question that motiv@@ ates my research is the following : if you look at humanity &apos;s lar@@ ge-@@ scale achie@@ v@@ ements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done histor@@ ically -- like for example , building the pyrami@@ ds of eg@@ y@@ pt or the pan@@ ama can@@ al or putting a man on the moon -- there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
that technology will be used on de-@@ extin@@ cted animals .
diseases spread . more resources are requi@@ red .
well , as chris poin@@ ted out , i study the human brain , the fun@@ ctions and structure of the human brain .
but before i go there , please allow me to share with you gli@@ mp@@ ses of my personal story .
so if you look , as i did , through this tour , and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entreprene@@ urs working in these very extreme conditions , look at the reci@@ pes that they come up with for learning , they look nothing like school .
which , when you actually have to design a bee@@ tho@@ ven poster , comes in handy , because the visual information of the lo@@ go and the actual poster is exactly the same .
we &apos;ve had a ro@@ cky relationship with that country and , in all fair@@ ness , the united states has not always been a very reli@@ able partner .
i think it &apos;s the best way of ver@@ i@@ fying histor@@ ical statistics .
day one , day two , day three , day four , day five , day six .

if the ancient gre@@ e@@ ks had found out about seas@@ ons in australia , they could have easily vari@@ ed their my@@ th to predict that .
now it &apos;s : i want to have a feeling , i need to send a text .
we see the pul@@ se and the seas@@ onal activi@@ ties that these animals are going on .

and he could come in and fix the flow .
i want them to be mar@@ ines .
in fact , the anony@@ mous ad@@ m@@ in job was to collect ideas , help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing .
now , an ide@@ al par@@ ent is someone who respon@@ ds like this : &quot; really ? an alien , hu@@ h ? what did it look like ? did it say anything ?
the age of behavior : where ideas and narra@@ tives were increasingly defin@@ ing behavior and identity and alle@@ gi@@ an@@ ces .
the earth invented the computer internet for its own benefit , and we now , being the top organis@@ m on this planet , are trying to allo@@ cate resources in order to protect the bio@@ sphere .
what caused it ?
when they &apos;re out of education , they do it on a computer .
we are on a planet of seven billion people , five billion mobile sub@@ scri@@ p@@ tions .
we &apos;ve already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regi@@ ons out of the several hundred .
but of course , as you &apos;re probably aware , even in adul@@ tho@@ od , people diff@@ er from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds , how often they do it and how ac@@ cur@@ ately .
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re always thinking of this guy as la@@ g@@ ging behind us , evolution@@ arily or somehow un@@ can@@ ni@@ ly cre@@ eping up on us , and in some cases , he gets places before us .
which , of course , i am not agre@@ eing with because , although i am 9@@ 4 , i am not still working .
and so , because the pris@@ on-@@ industrial complex is bank@@ rup@@ ting our states and cor@@ ro@@ ding our sou@@ ls , groups of fis@@ cal conser@@ va@@ tives and chri@@ stian conser@@ va@@ tives have come together to form a group called right on crime .

this lady is ellen van der zwe@@ ep . she &apos;s one of the best do@@ g-@@ train@@ ers in the world , and she belie@@ ves that we can do a lot more .
my mom left nai@@ rob@@ i , kenya .
these stories satur@@ ated my cells and ner@@ ves , and to be honest , i stopped sle@@ eping for three years .
and he said , &quot; the red cross has closed . &quot;
these are ent@@ ang@@ le@@ ment sc@@ ars .
here &apos;s how it went .
harv@@ est cont@@ amin@@ ated to@@ bac@@ co .
and it turns out , we &apos;ve even done it .
we have to come and attack this problem with a focus , with an effort that actually says , we &apos;re going to go to zero before the world ends .
and he &apos;s shown here with his favorite high school teacher .
please , please , stop refer@@ ring to y@@ ourselves as &quot; consum@@ ers . &quot; ok ?
now we are disco@@ vering a more accu@@ rate vision of the un@@ conscious , of who we are deep inside , and it &apos;s going to have a wonderful and profound and human@@ i@@ zing effect on our culture .
and i &apos;m sure ross can associ@@ ate that with design .
whether it &apos;s our clo@@ th@@ es , whether it &apos;s our cars , whether it &apos;s our bi@@ kes , whether it &apos;s our books or music , we are able to take our pos@@ s@@ essi@@ ons now and make them available to people we &apos;ve never met .
wow . let &apos;s go for it . that &apos;s the kind of stuff .
and it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can re@@ main healthy ourselves .
we have a process where we , you know , kind of put it into the computer and di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze it , and then a whole lot of analysis .
so it means that you can actually em@@ bed pretty clever algorith@@ ms and lots of other kinds of exten@@ d@@ able ideas into really simple devices .
it &apos;s a profound moral matter that eng@@ ages and should engage us all .
that is something that we should embra@@ ce -- a weal@@ thy china , a weal@@ thy india , a weal@@ thy africa .
he was taking me through the garden .
well , you know where this is head@@ ed .
and i can tell you stories about it , which makes it refle@@ ctive , and so you &apos;ll see i have a theory of emotion .
it suggests that there &apos;s all kinds of other things that motiv@@ ate us to work or be@@ have in all kinds of ways .
now i think the real key to doing it , to give a simple answer , is integra@@ tion .
it seems so element@@ ary .
according to world bank esti@@ mate , one trillion dollars is paid in bri@@ bes every year , wor@@ sen@@ ing the condition of the already worse off .
if you managed to rise to the very top , 200@@ ,000 or 40@@ 0,000 dollars a year is what you &apos;d hope to make .
unless you &apos;re stuck in a laboratory c@@ age -- and you know , if you spend your entire life in a little box , you &apos;re not going to be as pi@@ cky about who you have sex with -- but i &apos;ve looked in a hundred species , and everywhere in the wild , animals have favor@@ ites .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved as a species .
audience : 3@@ 7 .
okay , i &apos;m getting to the pun@@ ch . golden ra@@ ti@@ o , it &apos;s crazy .
the contr@@ ast in liter@@ acy rates is especially shar@@ p between chinese women and indian women .
the stars al@@ ig@@ ned , and she came back .
now compare that with real price incre@@ ments .
i called my mom .
we just need to put it together .
and the cho@@ ir conduc@@ tor there knew that i san@@ g and invited me to come and join the cho@@ ir .
he said , &quot; be happy .
people can come live under the new char@@ ter , but no one is forced to live under it .
but that &apos;s still not typical of the universe , because stars come in galaxies .
and she re@@ pur@@ pos@@ es them with fri@@ ll@@ s and ri@@ b@@ b@@ ons , and makes these fro@@ thy con@@ fe@@ ctions that she s@@ ells to women for their daughter &apos;s swe@@ et 16 or first hol@@ y comm@@ union -- those mi@@ le@@ st@@ ones in a life that people want to celebra@@ te all along the economic spectrum .
you &apos;re going to open an off@@ sh@@ ore plant in china , you &apos;re going to spend it all on sal@@ es and marketing , you &apos;re going to go to ta@@ hit@@ i , or whatever out there .
the world &apos;s many religi@@ ons have found so many ways to help people clim@@ b the sta@@ ir@@ case .
and so i &apos;ll just say , i think if you think money can &apos;t buy happiness you &apos;re not spending it right .
not just is the digital now far from the present , but it &apos;s in direct competition with it , and this is because not just am i ab@@ sent from it , but so are you .
g@@ b@@ m affec@@ ts about 10,000 people in the u.s. each year .
and here &apos;s the public service announ@@ c@@ ement for this project .
and then his si@@ de@@ ki@@ ck is a sea tur@@ tle , as i mentioned before , named fil@@ more .
and this is his hand@@ writing .
asi@@ de from , you know , getting people excited and wondering what the he@@ ck these blue dots were all over the place , it asked the school system to en@@ vision how it might become a cat@@ aly@@ st for a more connected community .
the bit that you can &apos;t see is the geni@@ us that created this .
we can introdu@@ ce electro@@ des within those circu@@ its .
to be new at ted -- it &apos;s like being the last high-@@ school virg@@ in .
but enor@@ m@@ ously different mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions here .
i &apos;ve stood at the de@@ ath@@ bed of several famous people , whom you would know .
it gener@@ ates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand , incredibly light , but it can run for months and years , provi@@ ding that very gent@@ le push .
mar@@ gar@@ et th@@ at@@ cher was my mother .
it &apos;s much more organic . it &apos;s much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
how do you get insi@@ ght ?
another beauti@@ fully designed new building ru@@ ined by the sound of a common wall light switch .
he &apos;d made a co@@ sm@@ es@@ is .
so we need bees and they &apos;re disappe@@ aring and it &apos;s a big problem .
apart from that , some of the heads count more than others .
this year -- maybe you could show the sli@@ des -- this year we &apos;re carrying this tre@@ o , which we had a lot to do with and helped hand@@ spring design it .
these are all very low-@@ budget videos , like quick prototyp@@ es .
and with the new generation of scan@@ ning tools , for the first time we can actually see individual inter@@ -@@ neu@@ ral fi@@ bers and see them process@@ ing and sign@@ aling in real time -- but then the question is , ok , we can get this data now , but can we understand it ?
now i &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
during the hot summer months , watching an out@@ door spor@@ ts match or conc@@ ert can be t@@ ant@@ amount to ba@@ king un@@ comfort@@ ably in the sun -- but it doesn &apos;t have to be . at the tedx@@ sum@@ mit in do@@ ha , physi@@ c@@ ist wol@@ f@@ gang k@@ ess@@ ling reve@@ als sustainable design innova@@ tions that cool us from above and below , and even colle@@ cts solar energy for later use .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
so the lu@@ ci@@ fer effect , although it foc@@ uses on the nega@@ tives -- the nega@@ tives that people can become , not the nega@@ tives that people are -- leads me to a psych@@ ological definition . evil is the exercise of power .
so they knew at that stage they could carry large wei@@ ghts .
so my students , my staf@@ f , we &apos;ve been cutting them open .
and those are fro@@ zen soli@@ d , and they &apos;re shi@@ pped to se@@ attle .
and the se@@ min@@ al moment was , i was getting on a plane in d@@ all@@ as , and in row two was a father , i pres@@ u@@ me , and a young boy about five , ki@@ cking the back of the chair .
she said that a small group of thou@@ ght@@ ful people could change the world .
this is what i saw .
the other dog doesn &apos;t have the butt@@ on .
one study by cor@@ ic@@ ell@@ i and na@@ gel gives a really shar@@ p , interesting answer .
and the inv@@ ent@@ or is in this audience .
music is the best way to re@@ store speech to people who have lost it through stro@@ kes , movement to people with par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease .
and you ren@@ der this with the most non-@@ specific material , which is d@@ ust itself .
you bring in a second group of people , and you say , &quot; oh , before we start , i got this box of c@@ and@@ y , and i don &apos;t eat c@@ and@@ y .
now , this idea that everything is a re@@ mix might sound like common sense until you &apos;re the one getting re@@ mix@@ ed .
and in fact , these same cells that are affec@@ ting k@@ im@@ bo here are also found affec@@ ting dogs in new york city , in mountain villa@@ ges in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as and in out@@ back australia .
and everyone &apos;s no@@ d@@ ding , because we all know this to be true .
in this ei@@ ght-@@ year period , 197@@ 7 to 85 , when we last paid attention , the economy grew 27 percent , oil use fell 17 percent , oil im@@ por@@ ts fell 50 percent , oil im@@ por@@ ts from the per@@ si@@ an gul@@ f fell 8@@ 7 percent .
so , what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today .
it &apos;s not like that electr@@ onic ab@@ s machine where , 15 minutes a month , you get was@@ h@@ board ab@@ s .
but , of course , i will have the w@@ inning hand .
so , last month , the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pa@@ e@@ dia britan@@ ni@@ ca announ@@ ced that it is going out of print after 24@@ 4 years , which made me no@@ stal@@ gic , because i remember playing a game with the col@@ o@@ s@@ sal en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia set in my home@@ town library back when i was a kid , maybe 12 years old .
har@@ dly appropriate at this moment in time .
how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survi@@ ves us , and the stress created in families by dying is enormous , and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in inten@@ sive care as by dying just about anywhere else , so dying in inten@@ sive care is not your top option if you &apos;ve got a choice .
and the dark ages are the time between when you put away the le@@ go for the last time as a kid , and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid &apos;s to@@ y .
so when i was little , my dad would sit me down at night and he would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to teach you about time and space in the future . &quot;
for that , we use an ini@@ tial measu@@ re@@ ment unit .
it &apos;s exciting to see that in terms of what we &apos;ve learned , but how many of those 4@@ ,000 diseases now have treat@@ ments available ?
because it took the will to do the right thing .
it &apos;s going to change the way we have children .
i had only this equipment -- my satelli@@ te phone , my computer and a plastic solar pan@@ el -- that i hi@@ de it in the forest .
and we saw a number of them , and this is most likely the ol@@ dest .
and as you can see , large amo@@ unts of the brain are not pur@@ ple , showing that if one person has a thi@@ cker bit of cortex in that region , so does his fr@@ at@@ ern@@ al t@@ win .
this is a collaboration between myself and don .
do you feel like you &apos;re moving a thousand miles an hour ?
but he li@@ kes to carry things from place to place .
we need to individu@@ alize scre@@ ening based on den@@ sity .
and so , to give an example , this is a project from last year , which is called the inter@@ sti@@ tial frag@@ ment process@@ or .
africa was truly fascinating for me .
when we didn &apos;t search , we had the illusion that there was no disease .
i don &apos;t want to talk like they do at the particular d@@ m@@ v that &apos;s close to where da@@ ve lives .
and what you see here is these cells glo@@ wing in the dark under certain wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths of light .
but some day , some day , maybe it &apos;s going to work .
and while this certainly rema@@ ined the key for a cure , this seemed extra@@ ordin@@ arily complicated to me .
what it comes down to , really , is four basic principles : learn from everyone , follow no one , watch for patterns , and work like hell .
and i was always going off to crow@@ ded b@@ ars when i really would have pre@@ fer@@ red to just have a nice dinner with friends .
one ha@@ zar@@ a said to his pas@@ h@@ tun coun@@ sel@@ or , &quot; if we were to have met some years ago , then we would have killed each other .
pro@@ -@@ ana , the pro@@ -@@ ana groups .
and the fourth thing , which i believe is most important , is &quot; the ideas that we need to anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te . &quot;
even fi@@ del ca@@ str@@ o now says that the only thing worse than being explo@@ ited by mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional capit@@ alism is not being explo@@ ited by mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional capit@@ alism .
i &apos;ll meet you at fri@@ gor@@ is . no . i don &apos;t think so .
and the nur@@ ses told me two things .
j@@ esse came to us at the ric to be fit with these stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art devices , and here you see them .
because when i decided to go into adverti@@ sing , i wanted to do -- i wanted to air@@ br@@ ush na@@ ked people on ice , for wh@@ is@@ key commer@@ ci@@ als , that &apos;s what i really wanted to do .
it was technologi@@ sts and human@@ ists at that big bibli@@ ot@@ e@@ ch conference .
it &apos;s what we do with that information that matters .
so i just bought one spec@@ im@@ en of everything which was sold on the ro@@ ad@@ side .
thank you .
income there sta@@ yed st@@ ag@@ nant , as it zo@@ om@@ ed ahead in the rest of the world .
but i was saying thanks all the time , every day , and i started to change my perspective .
they have sorts of ingre@@ di@@ ents that you br@@ ush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like bee@@ f .
first , this problem is just simply too important to continue ignor@@ ing because we think we know the answer .
but what you have here is actually four separate la@@ yers , and i &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate la@@ yers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and pres@@ ented to the student all at once , how that creates this im@@ patient problem solving .
for too long now , children with develop@@ mental dis@@ orders have suff@@ ered from mis@@ diagno@@ sis while their real problems have gone un@@ dete@@ cted and left to wor@@ sen .
and they squ@@ ir@@ t the water into their mou@@ ths .
and he cu@@ es in a fl@@ ute player like this .
except for the girl .
thank you .
now , while 4@@ sh@@ ba@@ b and &quot; the 99 &quot; may look new and sh@@ in@@ y , there is actually a very long tradition of this .
as you can see , you can play anywhere .
well let me show you .
we are obs@@ essed with gra@@ des because we are obs@@ essed with data , and yet gra@@ ding takes away all the fun from fail@@ ing , and a huge part of education is about fail@@ ing .
i need a little bit off . &quot;
so , let &apos;s start off with the positive control first , where we know the person was healthy .
companies like google have di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed many of them -- above 20 million actually .
and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappe@@ ar under the waves ; if the places where i &apos;d been born and gone to school and got married , if all those places were just going to disappe@@ ar forever .
just to illu@@ strate what to do about the nu@@ b of the problem , nam@@ ely , light vehi@@ cles , here are four ultra@@ -@@ light carb@@ on-@@ com@@ posite concept cars with low dra@@ g , and all but the one at the upp@@ er left have hy@@ bri@@ d drive .
and we came up with an embar@@ ras@@ sing@@ ly simple solution called save more , not today , tomorrow .
people were terri@@ fied of this disease .
and so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
and even though a hundred teams were there , these cars went no@@ where .
and once that happened , once this material was in la@@ tin , it formed the basis for mathematics text@@ books for almost 600 years .
here we have jun@@ o on its cru@@ ise to ju@@ pit@@ er , there .
that &apos;s visible to our eye , but it &apos;s the equivalent of in@@ fr@@ ared in the deep sea .
the perfect desert machine .
my dad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
how can the nervous system mis@@ interpre@@ t an inno@@ cent sen@@ sation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the mal@@ evol@@ ent sen@@ sation of the touch of the fl@@ ame ?
we can re@@ create this using a process of group dynam@@ ics to explain the patterns that we see all around the confli@@ cts around the world .
if it &apos;s a head you &apos;re dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted , but you &apos;re still a third of the way to your pattern again .
so it seems that the li@@ qui@@ ds , for some reason we don &apos;t understand , or during at least this seas@@ on , are appar@@ ently at the po@@ les of ti@@ tan .
but what i &apos;m saying from my very practical experience : if civil society does it right and jo@@ ins the other ac@@ tors -- in particular , governments , governments and their international institutions , but also large international ac@@ tors , in particular those which have commit@@ ted themselves to corpo@@ rate social responsibility -- then in this ma@@ gical tri@@ angle between civil society , government and private sector , there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world .
having a tele@@ phone in my country was a huge lux@@ ury .
happiness is the freedom of choice .
dur@@ ga , res@@ pl@@ en@@ dent , be@@ de@@ cked , beautiful , her 18 arms ready for war@@ f@@ are , as she ro@@ de a@@ stri@@ de her li@@ on into the bat@@ t@@ le@@ field to destro@@ y ma@@ h@@ ish@@ as@@ ur .
and so if you go and ask yourself , &quot; what on earth is artificial life ? &quot; , let me give you a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind tour of how all this stuff came about .
okay ?
the other thing that we don &apos;t often appreci@@ ate is it &apos;s not just at the point of production that poor people suff@@ er .
i was very stru@@ ck by nat@@ al@@ ie mer@@ ch@@ ant &apos;s songs last night , re@@ co@@ vering old po@@ em@@ s .
and what i &apos;m talking about is this .
or , when he &apos;s more rela@@ x@@ ed , the head comes down and the e@@ ars listen , either side .
oli@@ ver sac@@ ks : what hallu@@ cin@@ ation reve@@ als about our minds
started in corpo@@ rate america , and i was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual , that women and men would have just the same opportunities .
and we see lots of examples of these inno@@ v@@ ators using open government data , not simply to make app@@ s , but then to make companies and to hi@@ re people to build them working with the government .
and i was cle@@ ver@@ ly standing in the front y@@ ard when one came over the h@@ ill .
one of the tri@@ cky issues we had with the gi@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ i admini@@ stration was i had for@@ gotten how anti-@@ gra@@ ff@@ iti he was .
it became the only piano in the region , and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived , she could play it because she had learned all these rhyth@@ ms . anyway , we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home . we pur@@ ch@@ ased it .
then , i started dri@@ ll@@ ing down , thinking about the compu@@ tations i might want to do , trying to figure out what primi@@ tives they could be built up from and how they could be auto@@ ma@@ ted as much as possible .
magic is de@@ ception , but it is a de@@ ception we enjoy .
it actually is the largest marine mam@@ mal s@@ lau@@ ghter on the planet , with hundreds of thousands of these se@@ als being killed every year .
but what we &apos;re really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tis@@ su@@ es out of them .
the le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y chimpanze@@ e resear@@ cher jan@@ e go@@ od@@ all talks about tac@@ are and her other community projects , which help people in bo@@ om@@ ing african to@@ w@@ ns live si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side with thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed animals .
what is the average difference here ?
the driving force behind this project is my collea@@ gue sh@@ mu@@ li@@ k london , and , you see , just like sal@@ man did about 90 years ago , the trick is to surro@@ und yourself with brilliant people , because at the end , it &apos;s all about people .
my mother mira@@ cul@@ ously re@@ covered after a serious operation , and this man was ele@@ cted president of this country .
and it was my bo@@ y@@ hood dream to be a fi@@ ghter pilot .
and we did that , without using fire to damage the soil , and the plants are free to grow .
and mo@@ bility to your dest@@ ination is clearly solved .
we basically found out that you can use these smart bio@@ materials that you can actually use as a bridge .
i feel like i &apos;m coming home to talk about what i &apos;ve been away doing for 20 years .
then , as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emer@@ ge , they &apos;re lar@@ va@@ e . then they &apos;re pu@@ pa@@ e . then they come out as adult ants .
and in harvard , for instance , they send out a letter to under@@ gradu@@ ates -- fres@@ hmen -- telling them that they &apos;ll get more out of life , and more out of harvard , if they put on the bra@@ kes , if they do less , but give time to things , the time that things need , to enjoy them , to sa@@ vor them .
now we &apos;re going even further into science fi@@ ction .
there we go .
ye@@ p .
our own technologies are visible over inter@@ stell@@ ar di@@ stances , and thei@@ rs might be as well .
there are four societies : the kog@@ i , the wi@@ wa , the kan@@ k@@ wan@@ o and the ar@@ hu@@ ac@@ os .
it was made using these three techniques : copy , transform and com@@ bine .
and he said there was coming soon , depen@@ ding on the weather , but he &apos;d let me know when , and so with about four days notice , he said to go to this beach south of li@@ s@@ b@@ on , and a little after 9 , this guy will walk out of the water .
and so this is fra@@ ming -- l@@ um@@ ber , com@@ posite materials -- and it &apos;s kind of hard to get the em@@ bo@@ died energy out of that , but it can be a sustainable resource if you use f@@ sc@@ -@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied l@@ um@@ ber .
&quot; okay , jo@@ sh , why don &apos;t we give you some -- why don &apos;t we give you some zy@@ pre@@ x@@ a .
so that place , a little moon around ju@@ pit@@ er , is probably the prime can@@ di@@ date for finding life on a moon or a body outside the earth , that we know of .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
it &apos;s like when you &apos;re mean to your wife because you &apos;re mad at somebody else .
and that does not even inclu@@ de those that are traff@@ i@@ cked within country bor@@ ders , which is a substan@@ tial por@@ tion .
biolog@@ ist richard da@@ w@@ kins makes a case for &quot; thinking the im@@ prob@@ able &quot; by looking at how the human frame of re@@ ference limit@@ s our understanding of the universe .
oh , there have been some gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cky ones .
tell them what you think i mean when i talk about moves to prove . i &apos;ve talk about -- i think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstra@@ ct of how we see our practice and then the con@@ cre@@ te reality of it .
in fact , policy is par@@ amount .
he once said that science in his generation had become like a ra@@ z@@ or bla@@ de in the hands of a three-@@ year-old .
this gives a tremendous advantage to the attac@@ ker , because the defen@@ der doesn &apos;t know who to fight back against .
there &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
we obviously don &apos;t ask people to drive around and see how many car acci@@ dents they have . that would be a little co@@ stly pro@@ position . but we design tas@@ ks on the computer where we can measure , to milli@@ second accu@@ ra@@ cy , how good they are at swi@@ t@@ ching from one task to another .
and because my grandmother thought it was c@@ ute , and because they were my favorite , she let me keep doing it .
so it &apos;s probably better to fall into ti@@ bet because you &apos;ll live longer .
ss : ai@@ mee and i thought we &apos;d just talk a little bit , and i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distin@@ ctive ath@@ le@@ te .
we do it for fun , or as olymp@@ i@@ ans , or as profession@@ als .
now , we can use s@@ las@@ h in the way that we &apos;re used to , along the lines of , &quot; we &apos;re going to have a part@@ y-@@ s@@ las@@ h-@@ net@@ working s@@ ession . &quot;
it &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
they were tough questions . there &apos;s pol@@ ari@@ zed groups down there .
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choo@@ sing off@@ spring that looked a particular way and then bre@@ eding them .
but i really like that , so i wrote a book called &quot; the laws of simpli@@ city . &quot;
but i am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
and they then repor@@ ted that her father was co@@ ach@@ ing her .
the thing that was bad about col@@ oni@@ alism , and the thing which is resi@@ du@@ ally bad in some of our aid programs , is that it involved elements of co@@ er@@ ci@@ on and con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion .
and here we can see him getting the therapy .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is how to dete@@ ct it .
this was bert the tur@@ tle .
but with new or better vac@@ cin@@ es for malaria , t@@ b , hiv , p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , flu , we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time .
my interest in acting , especially bad acting , goes a long way .
and then you have poor old taste , which is like bar@@ ely the through@@ put of a po@@ cket calcul@@ ator .
we &apos;ve got increasing market st@@ alls selling local food , and in a survey that local students did for us , 4@@ 9 percent of all food tra@@ ders in that town said that their bottom line had increas@@ ed because of what we were actually doing .
you know , there is a fear of dying , and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid .
first , you start small .
well i didn &apos;t have that problem .
basically this was also a major out@@ break , a culture of dis@@ sent , a culture of basically non-@@ con@@ for@@ mis@@ m , which was not known before .
and the quality of sleep is de@@ gra@@ ded , and so is our re@@ co@@ very .
quite often qu@@ eu@@ es happen at the toll@@ s .
but if we add the no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ve on top of that , the fis@@ her@@ men are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is prote@@ cted .
when you constru@@ e it as &quot; cause the mouse to have something , &quot; you &apos;re doing something to the mouse , and therefore you express it as , &quot; give the mouse the mu@@ ff@@ in . &quot;
and it is the first time that tim has held kat@@ ie &apos;s hand in seven years .
we need to understand why they &apos;ve done the pen@@ sion accoun@@ ting the way they have .
because the nature of a wait is not just depen@@ dent on its nu@@ mer@@ ical quality , its du@@ ration , but on the level of un@@ certain@@ ty you experience during that wait .
these sur@@ ger@@ ies were actually now being effective .
that &apos;s more than the emissions from all electricity and industry , or from all the world &apos;s planes , tra@@ ins and automo@@ bil@@ es .
now , we all know the song : &quot; love is like oxygen . / you get too much , you get too high . / not enough , and you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
thank you very much .
it kind of fri@@ gh@@ tens me to think of how long ago that was .
it &apos;s where i really getting passion with what i &apos;m doing right up to now -- i &apos;m standing in front of you -- doing bot@@ any and wild@@ life conser@@ vation .
here it is back at home at that same hospital , developed a little further , 12 years later , working on patients from pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cs to geri@@ at@@ ri@@ cs .
so it &apos;s all about coal , and the chinese are here in the united states .
together : the j@@ ill and juli@@ a , the j@@ ill and juli@@ a , the j@@ ill and juli@@ a show . so@@ bu@@ le : why are all our hero@@ es so im@@ perfect ? why do they always bring me down ? why are all our hero@@ es so im@@ perfect ? stat@@ ue in the park has lost his cro@@ wn . willi@@ am fau@@ l@@ k@@ ner , dr@@ un@@ k and depres@@ sed . swe@@ en@@ ey : mm@@ m .
well , let &apos;s try to kill it with consumer electr@@ on@@ ics . &quot;
2007 was a great year .
zero to 10 . how high ? 10 . how certain am i that you &apos;re going to respond to me ? 10 . how much un@@ certain@@ ty ?
the secret to produ@@ c@@ tivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is le@@ tting dead people do your work for you .
let them take long lun@@ ches .
which is why i pre@@ fer the richard wil@@ k analog@@ y of glob@@ ali@@ zing the local and lo@@ c@@ ali@@ zing the global .
and this is a ti@@ tan class ship in the space game , e@@ ve online .
because i feel an ur@@ gen@@ cy about this .
but the single biggest lesson we learned is to rever@@ se the water@@ fall as much as possible .
so the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future , and this is cho@@ sen as an example .
where were they ? it got even more puzz@@ ling when we found dun@@ es .
they &apos;re typ@@ ing their program into the brow@@ ser , and you can see they didn &apos;t get it quite right , lady liber@@ ty is still se@@ asi@@ ck .
see but again , i told you , i don &apos;t have to worry with that .
it &apos;s a school where you do learn reading -- one of my favor@@ ites -- writing -- i was bad at it -- ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic .
that &apos;s the t@@ wel@@ f@@ th one .
second , it would en@@ able li@@ fel@@ ong learning .
this is an older lady . she has cancer of the li@@ ver as well as diabetes , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body in@@ t@@ act .
and the city has plan@@ ned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ feet of development that the high line is going to ring around .
if this is true , if these babies are designed to learn -- and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for -- we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanis@@ ms .
of course , he never built it , because he was always fi@@ dd@@ ling with new plans , but when it did get built , of course , in the 194@@ 0s , everything changed .
he was quite a figure .
and the rich man -- oh , de@@ ar -- cre@@ st@@ fallen .
but they know there is this my@@ th that children from the sl@@ ums cannot speak english well .
well , not the one we tag@@ ged !
and that &apos;s because the water prote@@ cted the bas@@ in from being im@@ pac@@ ted by astero@@ ids and me@@ te@@ or@@ ites .
now , some of my sc@@ or@@ es as a com@@ pos@@ er look like this , and others look like this , and some look like this , and i make all of these by hand , and it &apos;s really te@@ di@@ ous .
and you just saw mot@@ ts the research engineer , there , going into the mr@@ i system , and he was wearing go@@ g@@ gles .
number four : giant solar fl@@ ar@@ es .
so for example , we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a regular newspaper .
a lot of her research goes on in ca@@ ves , which can get pretty du@@ sty .
all right , from sk@@ ate physics to theore@@ tical physics .
and he read this , and he thought a person had decided that he was bor@@ ing , and it was very un@@ fortun@@ ate , and he said , &quot; you know , what are these , you know , ba@@ star@@ ds at google doing ?
so control is no longer a zer@@ o-@@ sum game .
and then chris sac@@ ca , who is now a de@@ ar friend mine , had comple@@ ted an ir@@ on man with 10@@ 3 degree temperature , said , &quot; i have the answer to your pra@@ yers . &quot;
yeah , i can trust you &apos;ll do that .
now , the story that i start telling my kids , it starts out like a hor@@ ror story .
i says , &quot; i enjo@@ yed your film . that &apos;s why . &quot;
so da@@ i man@@ j@@ u basically finished out middle school .
so this person is a key link in conne@@ cting mass media and social media together .
it &apos;s been dec@@ lin@@ ing and i believe it will continue to dec@@ line .
the computer can lo@@ c@@ alize who requ@@ est@@ ed the to@@ y if there &apos;s a word match .
&quot; do you agree or dis@@ agree ? &quot;
you think black entertain@@ ers have it hard finding work in this business ? i &apos;m a sus@@ pi@@ cious mul@@ at@@ to , which means i &apos;m too black to be white and too white to be doing it right .
now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the pe@@ ers teaching each other inside of a classroom .
it did not let up .
by the way , d@@ s@@ l is a klu@@ dge .
through his suffering , ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter understood how deeply inter@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated we are .
but go without for more than a month .
but as that space shu@@ ttle re@@ turns to earth , and as the astron@@ au@@ ts enter the earth &apos;s gravi@@ ta@@ tional field , they begin to see the effects of gravity .
and mat@@ the@@ w has made this remarkable obser@@ vation that i &apos;m just going to offer you and let it sit .
c@@ .@@ p@@ . s@@ now spoke of the two cultures : science on the one hand , human@@ i@@ ties on the other ; never the t@@ wa@@ in shall meet .
they don &apos;t need this . they need psychiat@@ ric help .
now you might think for smo@@ oth sur@@ faces we get inspiration here .
so , there was another one that i came across , and it &apos;s &quot; saving fish from dro@@ w@@ ning . &quot;
in this moving yet pra@@ g@@ matic talk , kev@@ in bal@@ es explains the business of modern sla@@ very , a multi@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar economy that under@@ p@@ ins some of the worst industri@@ es on earth . he shares stat@@ s and personal stories from his on-@@ the-@@ ground research -- and names the price of fre@@ eing every sla@@ ve on earth right now .
this is to this as this is to this . what is the next number in this sentence ?
t@@ k : okay , this was my goal .
so anyway , we began the journey .
now , at least with see@@ ds we have the potential for future life .
and i &apos;m going to show you why .
and this is a temp@@ le in japan for a budd@@ h@@ ist mon@@ k .
i don &apos;t think so . not a chance . but then , how on earth is it done ?
there &apos;s no dou@@ bt that from now on , the fourth of ju@@ ly will be remem@@ ber@@ ed not as the day of the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , but as the day of the discovery of the hig@@ gs bo@@ son .
you know , it &apos;s he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ing to me .
what do they like to eat ?
you feel like you &apos;re on top of your game and you can do anything you want .
the new ow@@ ners of indian cri@@ cket were not the old prin@@ ces .
it has created thousands , if not tens of thousands of jobs .
we &apos;re beginning to look inside the brain .
and many of you were doing what great , if you will , tri@@ b@@ al leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tri@@ be , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tri@@ be , and make intro@@ duc@@ tions .
we changed our lo@@ go , for the day , from the alien to a sp@@ las@@ h@@ y , to sort of help the cause .
when iran and israel &apos;s security im@@ per@@ a@@ tives dic@@ t@@ ated collaboration , they did so in spi@@ te of le@@ th@@ al ide@@ ological op@@ position to each other .
so in the theater , as much as the story is critical and the book and the language , the telling of the story , how it &apos;s told , the mechan@@ ics , the metho@@ ds that you use , is equal to the story itself .
often , people are good at things they don &apos;t really care for .
and the other cool thing is , not only can we move the camera around , we can also control time , so i can slide this jo@@ g di@@ al here to shu@@ ttle time forward , and now we can see what a sun@@ set on the is@@ s would look like , and they get one every 90 minutes .
they &apos;re cell@@ -@@ ori@@ ented .
they want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful , to be healthy , and to have a successful life .
the scientists tell us -- and they &apos;re only gu@@ ess@@ ing -- that we &apos;ve got to reduce green@@ house gas emissions by one half , and do it as fast as possible .
unless there &apos;s anybody in the audience that would like to volunte@@ er to stop eating ?
then we inter@@ fer@@ ed with the brain region that we found to integra@@ te good news in this task , and the optimis@@ m bi@@ as disappe@@ ared .
people are saying that it &apos;s moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood .
and then suddenly , i obviously knew at this point , there was a chance .
well , you look at modern h@@ unter gather@@ ers like ab@@ origin@@ als , who quar@@ ried for stone ax@@ es at a place called mo@@ unt is@@ a , which was a quar@@ ry ow@@ ned by the kal@@ ka@@ do@@ on tri@@ be .
and that finding has stood the test of time -- unfortunately even into more recent times , at virg@@ ini@@ a tech .
what this means is , even if you covered the whole of the united king@@ dom with energy cro@@ ps , you couldn &apos;t match today &apos;s energy consumption .
and all those phones were in the few urban places .
take a look .
so the three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half billion people that suff@@ er every year as a result , and the two million kids that die every year , will live .
this machine comes in at an ei@@ gh@@ th of the cost of the conven@@ tional machine that i showed you earlier .
in the late &apos; 7@@ 0s , early &apos; 8@@ 0s , there were others , and they were very effective .
that &apos;s the only reason that a land@@ l@@ ord needs to have them re@@ moved , because there &apos;s no protection from dis@@ crimin@@ ation of gl@@ bt people .
now , this leadership is a far c@@ ry from the traditional leaders that afri@@ cans have known for cent@@ u@@ ries .
we had evolution over time , and this un@@ belie@@ vable mortality rate in human beings : 5@@ 5 percent of people who have become infe@@ cted with h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 have , in fact , suc@@ cum@@ bed .
&quot; come to visit the children ?
and if you pun@@ ch the pun@@ ch card clock a hundred times in one day , the piece goes black and is not to be res@@ et until the next day .
they &apos;re 11 and 12 .
rb : i was dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic . i had no understanding of scho@@ ol@@ work what@@ so@@ ever .
there is also one big thing about the humor : it really hur@@ ts , because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously .
and because of this , we really decided we needed some more sophisti@@ cated technology .
ner@@ ves , if they are in@@ ju@@ red , can cause paraly@@ sis , can cause pain .
men are not frequ@@ ently part of preg@@ nan@@ cy care .
and humor is a good way , i think , to address serious issues .
public health care runs on the as@@ ha wor@@ ker , not the doctor .
he then sur@@ ve@@ yed the students , and the good news was the students , both men and women , thought hei@@ di and howard were equ@@ ally compe@@ tent , and that &apos;s good .
you need to connect it to their lives , hopefully not in a fe@@ ar-@@ based way , but one that they understand .
i gave of my time and my money , i gave when solutions were on s@@ ale .
they didn &apos;t get in as much trouble . they were better students .
i was fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . we were fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed .
you can catch er@@ r@@ ors with it , it &apos;s un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous in its reading , there are lots of good things about bin@@ ary .
but even here among us , most -- in the most advanced society in the world , we have poverty .
the psych@@ ologists mar@@ gar@@ et mar@@ shall and john brown studied students with high and low expec@@ tations .
ill@@ umin@@ ating the city was only the beginning .
if religion is the op@@ ium of the mas@@ ses , then for me , music is my one and only gan@@ ja .
i want to start with a story , a la se@@ th go@@ d@@ in , from when i was 12 years old .
these co@@ ws are used for bee@@ f . we &apos;re going to eat these co@@ ws .
so the mon@@ tan@@ a bre@@ wers and their custom@@ ers are concerned , and they &apos;re looking for some way to address the problem .
what you see over here , this yellow thing , this is not a death ray .
i want them , after they &apos;ve played this game , to have extra@@ cted an entire world that they &apos;re now inter@@ acting with .
robert w@@ right uses evolutionary biology and game theory to explain why we appreci@@ ate the golden rule , why we sometimes ignor@@ e it and why there &apos;s hope that , in the near future , we might all have the compassion to follow it .
just to show you , this really was fol@@ ded paper .
and here &apos;s the voice we call ro@@ ger j@@ r .
so as soon it has been to the sea , it changes the pattern of zer@@ o@@ es and ones here , and it knows always where it is on the beach . so it &apos;s very simple brain .
and actually , i can rel@@ ate to the whole like ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m thing and everything .
it &apos;s completely ir@@ relevant .
the third story is the idea that technology can solve everything , that technology can somehow get us through this completely .
and you go from being a healthy , rob@@ ust 2@@ 9@@ -year-old male to someone that cannot brea@@ the , cannot move , cannot speak .
cancer may kill you , but when you look at the numbers , ar@@ thri@@ tis ru@@ ins more lives .
and i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just sho@@ ot@@ ing a video with las@@ ers , but we also open sour@@ ced it , and we made it rele@@ ased as a google code project , where people could down@@ load a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own ver@@ sions of it .
and it &apos;s something that people have wanted forever .
and so it &apos;s a very , very important thing for them , and for their audi@@ ences .
i don &apos;t have a poin@@ ter here , but you see the green , sort of rec@@ tan@@ gle or tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ id ?
so it &apos;s actually a pa@@ per@@ cut that &apos;s nine y@@ ards long .
notice all of our ro@@ vers and all of our lan@@ ders have gone to the northern he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere .
we often t@@ ack@@ le problems from un@@ conven@@ tional an@@ gles , and , in the process , end up disco@@ vering alterna@@ tives or even better ways to do things .
i mean , i &apos;ve got the symptom@@ s .
now , this is 199@@ 0 , and then 200@@ 2 . and here &apos;s a proje@@ ction for 20@@ 15 .
so they told me that it &apos;s impossible to make someone walk .
i went in and i took them .
we can do multiple pas@@ ses through that same ent@@ ry .
and one of the largest fields right now , in the world of energy gri@@ ds , you hear about the smart grid .
so here &apos;s my question . my question is , how come when people have mental damage , it &apos;s always an active imagination ?
i got a spli@@ t reaction to that during the live performance , because there is some people who understand live sub@@ ti@@ tles are a kind of an oxy@@ mor@@ on , because usually there is someone making them after@@ wards .
we think we &apos;re going to save more next year .
if you were black , it was a summer of hate .
so one of these works is the &quot; sp@@ elling spi@@ der . &quot;
now , to bring that home , i thought i &apos;d inv@@ ent a little game .
so my pen@@ ch@@ ant for hu@@ g@@ ging other people has ear@@ ned me the ni@@ ck@@ name dr. love .
my colleagues tal y@@ ar@@ kon@@ i and r@@ uss pol@@ dra@@ ck have shown that the insu@@ la po@@ ps up in almost a third of all brain ima@@ ging studies that have ever been published .
i &apos;m going to dou@@ ble@@ -@@ click on ur@@ an@@ us , and we can see ur@@ an@@ us ro@@ tat@@ ing on its side along with its mo@@ ons .
the moment i say &quot; school , &quot; so many memor@@ ies come back to me .
we have about 1@@ 25 people internation@@ ally .
it &apos;s been shown to pro@@ mote pre-@@ fron@@ tal cortex development where a lot of cogni@@ tion is happening .
and bes@@ i@@ des , it &apos;s not like i was the first person ever to lose their sight .
it &apos;s a little bit like the days when we all had be@@ at@@ les al@@ bu@@ ms or e@@ a@@ gles al@@ bu@@ ms and we &apos;d make a copy of that on a c@@ asse@@ tte ta@@ pe , and let our friends copy that c@@ asse@@ tte ta@@ pe , and pretty soon , with suc@@ c@@ essi@@ ve generations that ta@@ pe sounds like g@@ arb@@ age .
one interesting problem is the stone isn &apos;t very hard .
when we &apos;re wrong about something -- not when we realize it , but before that -- we &apos;re like that co@@ yo@@ te after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down .
many je@@ ws and chri@@ sti@@ ans now feel like this , i know .
bring me a can@@ v@@ as and some paint , and i will paint a ver@@ meer much better than i sold that dis@@ gu@@ sting na@@ z@@ i .
and to this day , the page for star wars kid has a war@@ ning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page .
he@@ m@@ ing@@ way had his writing space .
so that &apos;s really the cru@@ x of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more step .
all si@@ sters , ex@@ cep@@ ting me .
you can tell politicians that these cu@@ ts &#91; can cost &#93; lives .
it &apos;s not a specific thing .
well how did that happen ?
we can all picture astron@@ au@@ ts in space .
and then , again , in a more , kind of traditional setting , this is a graduate student hous@@ ing in tor@@ onto , and it &apos;s very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a conne@@ ctive tissue to the city .
but it is a place where sex workers and their cli@@ ents come .
do@@ or@@ -@@ to-@@ door travel time is re@@ duced , because now , instead of lu@@ g@@ ging bag@@ s , finding a par@@ king space , taking off your shoes or pul@@ ling your airplane out of the han@@ ger , you &apos;re now just spending that time getting to where you want to go .
and we &apos;ve been surprised to find , as young parents , that there are almost more tab@@ o@@ os around par@@ enting than there are around sex .
because for them it &apos;s not a surgery test , it &apos;s an english test .
first , know your den@@ sity .
now , nar@@ row it down to the gra@@ y one , the green one and , say , the orange one .
the largest organis@@ m on the planet is a my@@ ce@@ li@@ al m@@ at , one cell wall thi@@ ck .
the last 20 years has been the age of interven@@ tion , and afghanistan is simply one act in a five-@@ act trage@@ dy .
obviously , life can teach us something in the entertain@@ ment section . life has a lot to teach us .
and we do this in what we call the be@@ e matri@@ x .
and if you think about the carbon in that , that would have come out of the atmosphere , into the sea and then lo@@ cked away in a building product .
and did i want to come with ?
have sex .
over 80 major diseases have been cra@@ cked at the genom@@ ic level , but this is quite extraordinary : more has been learned about the under@@ p@@ inn@@ ings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man .
so i tra@@ cked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in mal@@ i just outside of ba@@ ma@@ ko , and i asked him , &quot; how come you &apos;re making fra@@ c@@ tal f@@ ences ? because nobody else is . &quot;
flying mon@@ ks .
joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whi@@ st@@ le-@@ blo@@ wer , except that like almost all whi@@ st@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers , he wasn &apos;t a cr@@ ank at all , he was passion@@ ately de@@ vot@@ ed to the organization and the higher pur@@ pos@@ es that that organization ser@@ ved .
and we didn &apos;t know , for iraq what we were going to find .
to which i have to say , here &apos;s the thing with the sing@@ ing cat@@ s . that always happens .
but if you text now , or if you are someone who is aware of the sub@@ strate of tex@@ ting the way it &apos;s become , you &apos;ll notice that lo@@ l does not mean laugh@@ ing out l@@ oud anymore .
now , interest@@ ingly , they still sold ads for that music , if you played the sil@@ ent video .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country and it &apos;s also one with a great deal of influence .
because some@@ time i feel like stopp@@ ing and not doing it , because i didn &apos;t know what i was putting myself into .
i &apos;ve travel@@ ed a lot and no@@ where else have i found the passion mexic@@ ans have .
well , let me finish .
well , most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant , new , out@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ box thinking .
they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere , and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities , where the urban areas are much more warm than the ad@@ jac@@ ent rural areas , but we also have problems that , when we lose power , we can &apos;t open a window here , and so the buildings are un@@ in@@ habit@@ able and have to be made vac@@ ant until that air condi@@ tion@@ ing system can start up again .
so if you were in pal@@ m spr@@ ings ...
and i was stuck , because i didn &apos;t have any way to describe what i do .
there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do .
the crazy teacher -- that &apos;s me on the left , i d@@ ress up pretty , thank you , my wife , i love you for getting a good suit -- my passionate bor@@ ough president and a guy named george ir@@ win from green living technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this pat@@ ented technology .
but normal is mer@@ ely average .
and when he did , michael , the ar@@ chan@@ gel , was sent to ki@@ ck him out of hea@@ ven along with the other fallen angel@@ s .
pan tro@@ glo@@ dy@@ tes , the name we give him , means &quot; ca@@ ve d@@ w@@ eller . &quot;
and of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it .
help me and the security community make life much , much more difficult for cyber@@ crimin@@ als .
the problem is -- and i learned this from the research -- that you cannot sel@@ ec@@ tively num@@ b emotion .
i &apos;m talking about real sla@@ very .
in this case , sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , these mes@@ sages are hidden in electr@@ onic phenomen@@ a .
so it was paying the r@@ ent .
and when i didn &apos;t finish my dinner my mother would say , &quot; finish your food ! don &apos;t you know ? people like fi@@ de &apos;s family have nothing . &quot;
and they did have to@@ fran@@ il and other things -- m@@ ell@@ ari@@ l , who knows what .
einstein , do you want to say &quot; hi &quot; to all the ow@@ ls ?
and that &apos;s trans@@ mit@@ ted back to land immediately .
i tell you all of this because of what i think it means for the way communities come together .
they have lo@@ cated two consu@@ l@@ tan@@ ts , frank wil@@ son and na@@ te john@@ son , who are -- frank wil@@ son is a neuro@@ log@@ ist , na@@ te john@@ son is a mechan@@ ic .
and he said essentially , &quot; i have considered the issue .
it &apos;s in no@@ a@@ a , the national oce@@ an@@ ic and atmosp@@ her@@ ic admini@@ stration .
obviously , we hope that the stri@@ ke is -- that the issues are resol@@ ved as quickly as possible .
and re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it &apos;s nuclear re@@ ac@@ tors or meta@@ materials or wh@@ ale sex , the common -- or lo@@ west common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator -- is me .
i only learned this the other day . the ear@@ l of sandwi@@ ch didn &apos;t inv@@ ent the sandwi@@ ch .
it &apos;s kind of like land@@ ing on mars and looking out the window of your spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p at all the little green men who are surro@@ unding it and trying to figure out , &quot; how do i find out if they have emotions or not ? &quot;
intervie@@ wer : so it was enough to be sc@@ ary ? yeah , but i thought that was just me .
ca@@ it@@ ri@@ a o &apos;@@ nei@@ ll : that was me in front of our house in mon@@ son , mas@@ sach@@ use@@ t@@ ts last jun@@ e .
we exten@@ ded this idea . we te@@ sted it many times over , and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could tri@@ ck@@ le charge on solar energy , but most importantly connect to a car battery , because a car battery is a u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous source of power in places where there &apos;s not enough electricity or er@@ ra@@ tic electricity .
we &apos;re helping . we &apos;re doing better . we &apos;re doing good .
so why build robots like this ?
how do we take what those teachers are doing to their natural conclu@@ sion ?
it was , &quot; which color would you like ? &quot;
perhaps god allows or per@@ mit@@ s terrible things to happen , so that hero@@ ism and compassion can be shown .
so it &apos;s more dis@@ or@@ dered .
and i ultimately want to recy@@ cle that , put it back into the loo@@ s , maybe was@@ h hands with it , i don &apos;t know .
but now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
you know , they can be about function and beauty ; they can be about business strategy .
very much in the same way , it &apos;s very difficult to see astronom@@ ical sources , because of the atmosphere that &apos;s continu@@ ously moving by .
so , next i went to london .
now i have to ad@@ mit that this talk so far may sound ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly glo@@ om@@ y , but that is not my point .
the biggest languages are ger@@ man , japanese , french -- all the western european languages are quite big .
for me , my mother was prepar@@ ing &#91; me &#93; when i was a child to become a doctor , but i really didn &apos;t want to .
if we go beyond our solar system , we &apos;ve learned that the stars aren &apos;t t@@ win@@ k@@ ly points of light .
thank you .
i have so many questions , but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know .
your knowledge is limited , health is limited , and power is therefore limited , and the che@@ er@@ ful@@ ness is going to be limited .
now , i want to ask a question .
now the ene@@ my is inside the walls .
the students should teach their teachers .
the english language is as big as it is .
so here was the power of what a group of children can do , if you li@@ ft the adult interven@@ tion .
and in fact he found that in three quar@@ ters of the men the stuff just kind of slo@@ pped out .
and of course , that expan@@ sion was deeply impli@@ cated in the crisis .
and stop where you want .
it starts with a frame@@ work system where when the surge@@ on deli@@ vers the lec@@ ture using a frame@@ work of cap@@ tion@@ ing technology , we then add another technology to do video con@@ fer@@ en@@ cing .
you know if you are in an air@@ craft at 3@@ 0,000 feet and the cab@@ in depres@@ su@@ ri@@ zes , you can have oxygen .

and we enter the era of true person@@ alized medicine -- the right drug for the right person at the right time -- instead of what we &apos;re doing today , which is the same drug for everybody -- sort of block@@ bu@@ ster drug medi@@ cations , medi@@ cations which don &apos;t work for you , the individual .
seven hundred and fif@@ ty thousand gi@@ gs are now po@@ sted after two years , what people would do for five dollars .
and if we can cat@@ aly@@ ze a suppor@@ tive community to come around these individuals and to participa@@ te in their story by len@@ ding a little bit of money , i think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other &apos;s potential .
but in that 3@@ 50 years , the place has just under@@ gone a lot of changes .
and people magazine , i thought , got probably the best shot .
two stage rock@@ ets , rock@@ ets with video c@@ ameras on them , on-@@ board computers log@@ ging their fli@@ ghts , ro@@ cket gli@@ ders that fly back to earth .
next stop is west african heart institute , that we are going to be doing in port har@@ court , nigeria , as i said before . we will do other centers across west africa .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business -- they &apos;re entreprene@@ urs . they don &apos;t actually want to be doing what they &apos;re doing .
stop sig@@ ns were invented in 19@@ 15 , y@@ i@@ el@@ d sig@@ ns in 19@@ 50 . but that &apos;s all we got .
and we hope to be able to test some of einstein &apos;s theor@@ ies of general rela@@ tivity , some ideas in co@@ sm@@ ology about how galaxies form .
very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
maybe as people , because especially in israel , and maybe that little thing can change something .
so that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .

the 10 seconds actually are because we -- i don &apos;t know if any of you have ever thought about pl@@ ug@@ ging a t@@ .@@ v@@ . in when you use just a cor@@ d .

one reason is they are always compar@@ ing india with china .
and , unfortunately , on youtube , there &apos;s many cat@@ s ma@@ ting videos .
so he starts out with one line , and then two , and then four , and then 16 , and so on .
there was a dra@@ matic illu@@ stration of this actually a year ago -- cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , climate change conference .
and that &apos;s because they have better job opportunities and their state off@@ ers better social services .
he took the treatment , and on the way back , he dro@@ ve the tru@@ ck by himself .
we may not even be terri@@ bly far from it .
what is it that you think about just before you get a con@@ dom ?
so we formed cour@@ ser@@ a , whose goal is to take the best cour@@ ses from the best in@@ struc@@ tors at the best universi@@ ties and provide it to everyone around the world for free .
again you see the beautiful body language .
so why i believe that television has a con@@ science is that i actually believe that television directly refle@@ cts the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation -- that television is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our entire value system .
this is a so@@ le in new@@ ca@@ st@@ le .
it &apos;s a primi@@ tive form of abstra@@ ction , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ rus of the brain , because when that &apos;s dama@@ ged , these people lose the ability to engage in bu@@ ba ki@@ ki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
in a political campaign , you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action .
you see , when we speak of the big bang , we often have an image of a kind of co@@ s@@ mic explosion that created our universe and set space rus@@ hing out@@ ward .
and the two here are just examples .
when i was little -- and by the way , i was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18@@ th century wat@@ ch@@ maker .
here &apos;s how it works .
and we had about 10@@ .@@ 2 million plastic sur@@ ger@@ ies in the united states , except that with the technologies that are coming online today , today &apos;s cor@@ rec@@ tions , d@@ ele@@ tions , aug@@ ment@@ ations and en@@ han@@ c@@ ements are going to seem like child &apos;s play .
imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is beg@@ ging and you &apos;re about to approach them .
in the words of president obama , &quot; if the taliban take over again , they will invi@@ te back al-@@ q@@ a@@ e@@ da , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . &quot;
could we di@@ al-@@ in information pre@@ cis@@ ely where we want it to go ?
maybe a third — and you see everybody has their back to the wall and they have food and coffee down the way and they &apos;re in their own little personal bubble .
because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that george could give ali@@ ce the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
person@@ alized cancer treat@@ ments are the fli@@ p side of person@@ alized bio@@ weapons , which means you can attack any one individual , including all the people in this picture .
so what we &apos;re doing is plac@@ ing these electro@@ des throughout the brain .
what do you think i &apos;m looking at ?
when i was a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at negoti@@ ating the dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment tre@@ a@@ ties with the so@@ vi@@ et union in gen@@ ev@@ a in the 197@@ 0s , we succe@@ e@@ ded because we understood we shared a dest@@ in@@ y with them .

take an arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary example , long beach , california , you can go and have a look at what re@@ co@@ very money they &apos;ve been spending on different things such as energy .
a collea@@ gue of mine was recor@@ ding in the american mid@@ west around this pon@@ d that had been formed maybe 16@@ ,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age .
she went to school .
nothing bad happened .
this goes into the more sophisti@@ cated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi-@@ step separ@@ ation process begins .
a place where most men would love to be .
today , the united states and china are the two leading econom@@ ies in the world .
we organized into cities . we had many people .
i mean , there are a few laun@@ ches you &apos;ve done where the brand maybe hasn &apos;t worked quite as well .
do you remember when they thre@@ w the co@@ ke bottle out of the airplane , and it land@@ ed on the ground , and it didn &apos;t break ?
we then process these hus@@ ks with some basic equipment .
thank you .
who are the w@@ inn@@ ers and who are the los@@ ers in iran ?
many years ago , when we first started going out , she was working for the b@@ b@@ c in britain , and i was , at that stage , working in america .
in other words -- and i think you see where this is going -- no reason to live .
i came home to my wife and i said , &quot; i created a character after you . &quot;
lea@@ ther@@ bac@@ ks and tu@@ at@@ ar@@ as are e@@ cho@@ es from that era .
so what &apos;s world@@ changing ?
but even between those three categ@@ ories , it &apos;s too wide a gul@@ f .
and as you come from the north , it is all ma@@ son@@ ry growing out of the sand cli@@ ff@@ s as you come from the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as and ev@@ o@@ king the tradition of the for@@ tr@@ ess .
why is this important ? because it shows confidence .
and this was one of those cases that went on and on .
notice something interesting that this impli@@ es -- nam@@ ely , that when people get to the future , they will change their minds .
that &apos;s what technology really wants .
and i hear that story over and over .
so if we &apos;re going to study vi@@ ral ch@@ at@@ ter , we need to get to these popu@@ lations who have inten@@ sive contact with wild animals .
what do you think these people are doing ?
there was none in place -- no associ@@ ation , no n@@ gos , nothing -- no e@@ ye@@ wit@@ n@@ esses .
so there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work .
because they survi@@ ved their technology , we could do it too .
a better mu@@ star@@ d ! a more expensive mu@@ star@@ d !
but first , see what a mis@@ er@@ able lot we are .
i won &apos;t d@@ well on the pri@@ cing at all .
and of course , it &apos;s made ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely for ted 20@@ 12 .
wow !
you &apos;ve mis@@ understood totally , &quot; he said .
but i must say , i &apos;ll never forget , when i was 13 years old , this happened .
he said that one of the reasons he invented be@@ bo@@ p was that he was pretty sure that white musi@@ cians wouldn &apos;t be able to repli@@ cate the sound .
pretty powerful .
something amazing happened during this sho@@ ot .
so i want to take you on a trip to an alien world .
you want to see the classi@@ c swe@@ at@@ shop , meet me at ma@@ dis@@ on square garden , i &apos;ll take you down the street , and i &apos;ll show you a chinese swe@@ at@@ shop .
and they didn &apos;t achieve powered man flight , and the w@@ right brothers beat them to it .
the ti@@ tle is &quot; obser@@ va@@ tions of in-@@ u@@ ter@@ o ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ation . &quot;
the first is that it lives up to the philosop@@ hi@@ cal promise of open-@@ source . everybody who works on a project has access to all of the source code all of the time .
i was very depres@@ sed . i said , but i can make a difference in this field .
he listen@@ ed to me carefully , and respon@@ ded with a gr@@ in .
so you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent grown and you didn &apos;t know that it was going to grow up to a cas@@ so@@ war@@ y , you would think they were two different animals .
and this was at the beginning of elec@@ tions .
but also , don &apos;t shop .
nobody che@@ cks bo@@ xes .
a@@ g : because i am an old man . i am actually 15@@ 8 .
when we give people the opportunity to che@@ at , they che@@ at .
that &apos;s a third side act .
the political is not an ene@@ my of architecture .
unfortunately , ocean ro@@ w@@ bo@@ ats very r@@ ar@@ ely go in a straight line .
and for those who are ready to get married and buy their a@@ partment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first a@@ partment .
it was very difficult actually , putting these people in the machine , because they were in such bad shape .
but we also have a stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward political impact .
i &apos;ve as@@ sum@@ ed that she lives in an average hou@@ se@@ hold with average air pollu@@ t@@ ant levels .

but if there is someone here who has an au@@ ti@@ stic child , or knows an au@@ ti@@ stic child and feels kind of cut off from them , what ad@@ vice would you give them ?
so one ev@@ ening , he said , &quot; look , you are doing all these things , but isn &apos;t it nice , also , to build something within ? &quot;
so that means that these flies have two ab@@ norm@@ ali@@ ties , or phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , as we gene@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts call them , that one fin@@ ds in ad@@ h@@ d : hyper@@ activity and learning dis@@ ability .
and what they did was , they sent wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh down to physi@@ cally separate her mor@@ tal self from her spirit self .
and the same thing happens at the 50@@ th per@@ centi@@ le , around 8@@ 0,000 .
after a le@@ th@@ al 199@@ 5 heat wave turned re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator tru@@ cks from the popular taste of chicago festi@@ val into ma@@ k@@ es@@ hi@@ ft mor@@ gues , chicago became a recogni@@ zed leader , tam@@ ping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cool@@ ing centers , ou@@ tre@@ ach to vulnerable neighbor@@ ho@@ ods , plan@@ ting trees , creating cool white or vege@@ t@@ ated green roo@@ fs .
he took 20@@ ,000 and then 6@@ 0,000 dis@@ ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rat@@ s -- put them on a chip .

all value is percei@@ ved value .
and therefore , as with all biology , you get sele@@ ction through scre@@ ening , whether you &apos;re scre@@ ening for hydro@@ gen production , or chemical production , or just vi@@ ability .

mor@@ gan o &apos;@@ nei@@ ll : so , on jun@@ e 1@@ st we weren &apos;t disaster experts , but on jun@@ e 3@@ rd we started fa@@ king it .
i can give you 30 examples , right now -- bob com@@ bs , the pi@@ g farmer in las v@@ eg@@ as who colle@@ cts the un@@ e@@ aten sc@@ ra@@ ps of food from the cas@@ in@@ os and fe@@ e@@ ds them them to his s@@ wine .
this kind of diagra@@ m is called a ballo@@ on race .
what happens if one of the eng@@ ines st@@ ops ?
the virus is de@@ fe@@ ated .
and they expect these people who work for them to do great work -- i would hope , at least .
it &apos;s easy to see ler@@ o@@ y getting the check , right ?
and maybe the har@@ dest part about my life en@@ ding is that i learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as i would fru@@ strated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer sta@@ ying small , sta@@ ying right under the ra@@ dar .
i want to say why psychology was good , why it was not good and how it may become , in the next 10 years , good enough .
there &apos;s this absolute concent@@ ration of being , the absolute concent@@ ration of consciousness , awareness , an absolute lo@@ c@@ us of compassion and love that defin@@ es the primary at@@ tribu@@ tes of di@@ vin@@ ity .
peter m@@ oly@@ neu@@ x : what are you going to do , di@@ mit@@ ri ?
people , children were dying of k@@ was@@ hi@@ or@@ k@@ or .
it &apos;s che@@ aper for that person to don@@ ate 100,000 dollars every year to the hunger char@@ ity , save 5@@ 0,000 dollars on their ta@@ xes , so still be roughly 2@@ 7@@ 0,000 dollars a year ahead of the game , now be called a phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ ist because they don@@ ated 100,000 dollars to char@@ ity , probably sit on the board of the hunger char@@ ity , indeed , probably super@@ v@@ ise the poor so@@ b who decided to become the ce@@ o of the hunger char@@ ity , and have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence and popular pra@@ ise still ahead of them .
all this stuff that happens around .
and you don &apos;t leave them where they are . you nu@@ dge them forward .
and the only b@@ old colors are the re@@ ds of the pan@@ ic butt@@ ons .
the first transformation -- and , by the way , the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else .
na@@ to forces went in , and the ser@@ bi@@ an army with@@ dre@@ w .
and you know , not everybody &apos;s going to like everything you do , and i &apos;ve certainly developed a thi@@ ck skin thanks to internet comm@@ ents , but that one &apos;s always bo@@ ther@@ ed me , because we don &apos;t have too much time on our hands .
put a fl@@ ame under it , the pi@@ ston moves up .
and this has come as a great bo@@ on to them .
but -- you know what i &apos;m say &apos;@@ n ?
i &apos;ve clearly got mass . where does it come from ?
on the lower left there is a picture of mother of pe@@ ar@@ l forming out of se@@ a@@ water . it &apos;s a la@@ y@@ ered structure that &apos;s miner@@ al and then poly@@ mer , and it makes it very , very tough .
wait for the go . i &apos;ll say go .
and this project began essentially on my kitchen table .
and we &apos;re going to fly around , and we &apos;ll fly around , and you &apos;ll see occasi@@ on@@ ally a couple of fil@@ am@@ ents inter@@ se@@ ct , and you get a large clu@@ ster of galaxies .
each of these ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical colum@@ ns would produce a note .
the belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep , pro@@ ving that the african is capable of gover@@ ning himself .
everyone has seen a street person , un@@ k@@ em@@ pt , probably ill@@ -@@ f@@ ed , standing outside of an office building mutter@@ ing to himself or shou@@ ting .
at five minutes to six in the after@@ noon , we come together at the natural history museum in ro@@ tter@@ dam , the du@@ ck comes out of the museum , and we try to disc@@ uss new ways to prevent birds from colli@@ ding with windows .

and that &apos;s bu@@ mp@@ top . thanks !
and the reason that dile@@ m@@ ma aro@@ se is , it turns out , that social learning is visual the@@ ft .
now i &apos;m not trying to be negative by thro@@ wing all these ob@@ stac@@ les out and expla@@ ining what &apos;s in our way .
i &apos;m particularly interested in how you can &apos;t rely on your own perception .
we can see the same processes at work in terms of the commer@@ ce bank -- its depen@@ dence on natural venti@@ lation , the way that you can model those gar@@ dens , the way they spi@@ ral around .
and what we &apos;re seeing is not just the potential death of the eastern he@@ m@@ lock species -- that is to say , its extin@@ ction from nature due to this inv@@ ading par@@ asi@@ te -- but we &apos;re also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are mer@@ ely the sub@@ strate for the a@@ er@@ ial lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th of the sky that exists in their crow@@ ns .
and the problem with le@@ verage is it makes the u.s. financial system look like this .
in seven years , we could pull off an industrial mission to sha@@ ck@@ le@@ ton and demon@@ strate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-@@ earth orbit .
turns out sing@@ apo@@ re and h@@ ong kon@@ g are cities that made huge ga@@ ins on the value of the land that they ow@@ ned when they got started .
but today , with glob@@ alization , with ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing , english has become a language of as@@ pi@@ ration .
vo@@ d@@ ka , new year &apos;s e@@ ve -- new partner for the spring .

now , one of the studies fund@@ ed by the at@@ kins center found that 70 percent of the people were con@@ sti@@ p@@ ated , 65 percent had bad breath , 5@@ 4 percent had hea@@ da@@ ches – this is not a healthy way to eat .
now , you can see , this is the problem of shif@@ ting compar@@ is@@ ons , because what you &apos;re doing is , you &apos;re compar@@ ing the 100 bucks to the pur@@ ch@@ ase that you &apos;re making , but when you go to spend that money you won &apos;t be making that compar@@ ison .
you can be yourself and have your face .
the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own video@@ dis@@ c as well as build your own hyper@@ card stac@@ ks .
one was a mis@@ sed opportunity .
we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn &apos;t last forever , our sun doesn &apos;t last forever .
and you know very little about me actually .
this last fall , i went to the s@@ now and ice data center in b@@ ou@@ l@@ der , color@@ a@@ do , and talked to the researchers here in mon@@ ter@@ ey at the na@@ val post@@ graduate laboratory .
it also makes sense in very strong markets .
i start speaking english , learning english , about a year ago .
so teachers become great ac@@ tors and great ac@@ tr@@ esses , and we come to work when we don &apos;t feel like it , and we &apos;re listening to policy that doesn &apos;t make sense , and we teach anyway .
we &apos;re moving to what i would think of as a fully connected system , and we have global decisions to make in this system , decisions about climate , about fin@@ ance systems , about resources . and think about it -- if we want to make an important decision about buying a house , we don &apos;t just go off . i mean , i don &apos;t know about you , but i want to see a lot of houses before i put that much money into it .
so this is a problem for policy . it was a problem for my research .
everybody can experience music in a profound way , we just have to make different tools .
but that &apos;s when i take out his letters and i read them , and the paper that tou@@ ched his hand is in mine , and i feel connected to him .
yes , you te@@ ar up the &quot; el@@ event@@ h comm@@ and@@ ment &quot; -- national so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty .
the other challenge was , how do you give high-@@ tech or more advanced treatment and care ?
so , quite under@@ stand@@ ably , quali@@ ties like magne@@ tis@@ m and char@@ is@@ ma suddenly come to seem really important .
this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .
he electri@@ fi@@ es only the outside .
i expect health and joy and family and community .
so let me reas@@ sure you about something .
i mean , they weren &apos;t really je@@ ans , they were more kind of , like , leg@@ g@@ ings , but , like , i guess they &apos;re actually kind of more like je@@ g@@ g@@ ings , like , but i think — &quot; and you &apos;re just like , &quot; oh my god .
they could have a mental image of the cell as a large , bu@@ st@@ ling , hu@@ gely complicated city that &apos;s occu@@ pi@@ ed by micro@@ -@@ machines .

for half the people , the article inclu@@ ded a brain image , and for the other half , it was the same article but it didn &apos;t have a brain image .
and these technologies are going to be market@@ ed to all of us as pan@@ ac@@ e@@ as for dec@@ eit , and they will prove incredibly useful some day .
it &apos;s just necessary or interesting that it might have one good , unique tra@@ it .
i don &apos;t get it .

my friend peter says , &quot; if you love something , give it away . &quot; so , please .
and then we put a lead , which is a wire , in the right vent@@ ri@@ cle inside the heart , which does the electro@@ gra@@ m , which is the signal vol@@ tage from inside the heart .

you have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today .
this is not your normal gar@@ den-@@ variety flu .
and then i tried the mel@@ ting business , and i mel@@ ted it .
so you say , &quot; a@@ w , come on s@@ her@@ mer , anybody can do that in a psy@@ ch 10@@ 1 text with an illusion like that . &quot;
the answer is , the system certainly has software , but no , we &apos;re not provi@@ ding the education content .
but i &apos;d say he &apos;d been to hell@@ es@@ poin@@ tic@@ a depres@@ si@@ o recently .
there was no day of inter@@ cultural co@@ operation .
since , our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in california .
we are facing an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented number , scale of dis@@ ast@@ ers .
since then , the auth@@ ors have won on 12@@ 9 million distin@@ ct occasi@@ ons , publi@@ sh@@ ing books .
you have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself .
i mean , the city &apos;s the best g@@ aller@@ y i could imagine .
half of that runs pump@@ s and fan@@ s .
but it was left at that . no one seemed to be asking why .
here is where the problem is , and i &apos;ll explain to you as well as i can what the problem is .
and there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my clo@@ s@@ est friends and telling them what they meant to me .
sign language .
and he made a few comm@@ ents .
this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i didn &apos;t know i would discover .
and we , in fact , when we have played this over the world .
but there &apos;s a lot of technology going .
they pay me to teach a lesson .
so this was , you know , un@@ expected from the world &apos;s -- -- and so , it was held together by hydro@@ gen bon@@ ds between phosp@@ hate groups .
put this on top .
it &apos;s a great honor to be here talking about cities , talking about the future of cities .
i took more than my body had to offer .
mani@@ fest dest@@ in@@ y .
we get people coming to the foundation all the time .
that means our students can read .
we didn &apos;t have words like crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing and radical collaboration when i had my accident .
this one , i would say , was a serious challenge .
and so it &apos;s got everything , right ?
it &apos;s important because mis@@ reading is really the chance for complic@@ ation and opportunity .
but of course , that &apos;s a little bit like k@@ is@@ sing your sister as far as driving a car , so the kids want to do a ste@@ ering whe@@ el ; so they draw a ste@@ ering whe@@ el .
as a matter of fact , this is by far the most important com@@ mission that leon@@ ardo has ever had , and for doing this great ma@@ ster@@ piece , he was named the number one artist influence at the time .
and this is actually still , of course , experiment@@ al , not for use in patients .
these are chemical clo@@ cks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
and &quot; the end of print &quot; is now in its fif@@ th prin@@ ting .

and then finally , in l@@ .@@ a. i was asked to do a sculp@@ ture at the foot of inter@@ state bank to@@ wer , the highest building in l@@ .@@ a .
david mil@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; de@@ ad@@ wood &quot; and other amazing tv shows , has a really good descri@@ ption for this .
and the second go@@ at says , &quot; no , the book was better . &quot;
well , that &apos;s a problem because one way or another , you have to get this guy moving because it &apos;s getting dark soon and dangerous .
but we think we got the dynam@@ ics right of the robot .
so first there &apos;s speech , and then writing comes along as a kind of arti@@ fi@@ ce .
we re@@ moved the ki@@ o@@ s@@ ks .
you &apos;ve got to get out of there .
government prote@@ sters became si@@ del@@ ine che@@ er@@ leaders .
my mom is a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian , and i asked her .
i asked them what kind of building it was .
and there isn &apos;t much we can do about that .
the question is : has that damage er@@ ased the connec@@ tom@@ e ?
you &apos;ll notice that transpor@@ tation &apos;s sort of second down that list , but that &apos;s the conversation we mostly hear about .
for example , only americans now in their 7@@ 0s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression , the experience of living through a world war , and ag@@ oni@@ zing whether or not dro@@ pping atom@@ ic bom@@ bs would be more horri@@ ble than the likely consequences of not dro@@ pping atom@@ ic bom@@ bs .
well yeah , i tried that .
if we take carbon nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , you know , i@@ i@@ j@@ im@@ a discovered them in 199@@ 1 , they just have incredible properties .
that isn &apos;t really going to attra@@ ct him .
so that &apos;s one tool that we can use to very quickly monit@@ or the history of a page .
well , what i didn &apos;t know was , and what we found out was -- these guys , they can &apos;t even like talk to each other under those conditions .
they &apos;re all building cities on the model that we invented in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , which is really ob@@ so@@ le@@ te , i would argue , and there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities that are being plan@@ ned all over the world .
what time is it ? what time is it ?
i think that , in fact , that &quot; all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning .
your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it up@@ d@@ ated -- like , you have to check your computer in order to do that , right ?
and i would add that bin laden and his follo@@ wers are consci@@ ously de@@ vot@@ ed to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy , or at least capit@@ alist democracy , on the one hand , and the world of islam as they see and define it .
and there &apos;s a s@@ light sense that is@@ ai@@ ah knows this , because he says , this is god speaking , of course , &quot; i have called the@@ e by thy name though tho@@ u hast not known me . &quot;
and we &apos;ll go a lot further than that .
the movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the sli@@ des@@ how i gave two ni@@ ghts ago , except it &apos;s a lot more entertain@@ ing . and it comes out in may .
he &apos;ll introdu@@ ce it for a second and then i &apos;ll stop , i &apos;ll talk for a second .
where there is no trust , the music quite simply with@@ ers away .
and we just count on down to the bottom .
and he says , &quot; it &apos;s not about a scientific ren@@ der@@ ing of a she@@ ep .
you know what &apos;s going to happen , when it &apos;s going to happen , how it &apos;s going to happen -- what would you feel ?
and you &apos;re not alone . around the world , almost every culture , one of the top cu@@ es is eyes . but the research over the last 50 years says there &apos;s actually no reli@@ able cu@@ e to de@@ ception , which ble@@ w me away , and it &apos;s one of the hard lessons that i learned when i was cu@@ st@@ oms off@@ ic@@ er .
actually , in ger@@ man , it &apos;s nein nein .
and they said , &quot; it &apos;s un@@ limited , it &apos;s un@@ limited . &quot;
how do you deal with a bul@@ ly without becoming a th@@ u@@ g ? in this wise and sou@@ l@@ ful talk , peace activ@@ ist sc@@ ill@@ a el@@ wor@@ thy maps out the skills we need -- as nations and individuals -- to fight extreme force without using force in return . to answer the question of why and how non-@@ violence works , she ev@@ o@@ kes histor@@ ical hero@@ es -- a@@ ung san su@@ u k@@ y@@ i , ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi , nel@@ son mand@@ ela -- and the personal philosop@@ hi@@ es that powered their pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful prote@@ sts . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
chen ying : &quot; when i went home for the new year , everyone said i had changed . they asked me , what did you do that you have changed so much ?
i &apos;ve shown you that we can use deep brain stimu@@ lation to treat the motor system in cases of par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease and dy@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
but einstein realized that new@@ ton had left something out of the story , because even new@@ ton had written that although he understood how to calcu@@ late the effect of gravity , he &apos;d been un@@ able to figure out how it really works .
and then i realized one day , there &apos;s an easier solution to this .
and therefore , you &apos;re not talking about incre@@ mental innovation , you &apos;re talking about dis@@ rup@@ tive innovation .
for 50 years , it &apos;s been about hop@@ es and fe@@ ars and promis@@ es of a better world . and i got to thinking , you know , who else talks that way ?
we &apos;ve got to make something better than what we &apos;ve got .
i &apos;ll leave you with what i call the bak@@ er &apos;s bl@@ ess@@ ing .
so , i decided we &apos;ve got to do this .
and also we wanted to free up the e@@ ars , so the sound actually goes through , condu@@ cts straight to the b@@ ones in your cr@@ ani@@ um , which is a little bit fre@@ ak@@ y at first , but you get used to it .
they just met once a week for a year .
and i was a bit slow , i didn &apos;t really take too much notice .
volunte@@ ers fle@@ w in , ad@@ ded a whole bunch of devices , and for the next 12 months , mes@@ h networks were the only wir@@ eless that was happening in new or@@ le@@ ans .
one could say this is about community , colle@@ c@@ tivity .
it &apos;s coming from us .
and if each of us who car@@ es about the different things we care about got up off our bu@@ t@@ ts and volunte@@ ered as much time as we could , we would change this world , we would save this world .
one of the opportunities i had was one person was working on a really interesting micro@@ magnetic res@@ on@@ ance ima@@ ging machine with the ni@@ h .
and so dna didn &apos;t become a useful molecule , and the law@@ yers didn &apos;t enter into the equ@@ ation until 197@@ 3 , 20 years later , when bo@@ yer and co@@ hen in san francisco and stanford came up with their method of re@@ combin@@ ant dna , and stanford pat@@ ented it and made a lot of money .
the only progra@@ mm@@ ers who can change it are people who &apos;ve specifically been given per@@ mission to access it , and they &apos;re only allowed to access the sub-@@ section of it that they have per@@ mission to change .
and we can ro@@ tate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction , which has this nice h@@ ex@@ ag@@ onal symme@@ try .
that &apos;s a go@@ od@@ b@@ ye for a man who was larger than life , a go@@ od@@ b@@ ye for a man for whom anything , well , almost anything , was possible , a go@@ od@@ b@@ ye for a man who kept hope alive .
i , like most of you , was sitting down , the day after christ@@ mas in 2004 , when i was watching the de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing news of the asi@@ an tsun@@ ami as it roll@@ ed in , playing out on tv .
one of the lo@@ cations was this place called tiger beach , in the northern ba@@ ham@@ as where tiger sharks ag@@ gre@@ gate in s@@ hal@@ low water .
so this work from this period is mostly like -- you know , this is a work called &quot; light makes dark . &quot;
and if we were able to rei@@ ter@@ ate , then the fing@@ ers of our hand would be people who looked like us , and they would have people on their hands and so on .
and this is a rare action shot , ladies and gentle@@ men .
now , 100,000 feet , if you fly cros@@ s-@@ country to los angeles , you fly 3@@ 7@@ ,000 feet .
look around the room : cha@@ irs , wood , everything around us has to change or we &apos;re not going to li@@ ck this problem .
so we use electricity to dic@@ tate how they fire , and we try to block their mis@@ behavior using electricity .
you &apos;ll keep using it . it is the cle@@ an@@ est of all .
it was just going 65 -- to zero ?
it seems like when i tell that story of brian to my class , a lot of them want to come up after class and tell me about their similar experience , how a teacher shu@@ t them down or how a student was particularly cru@@ el to them .
as i went back , every time i went , i found that my neighb@@ ors &apos; girls were getting married .
why didn &apos;t they hang around in trees at good size , and why didn &apos;t they bur@@ row ?
so what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights ?
without looking at your cell phone directly yet , can you remember the ic@@ on in the bottom right corner ?
peter ty@@ ack of wo@@ ods hole talks about a hidden wonder of the sea : under@@ water sound . on@@ stage at mission blue , he explains the amazing ways wh@@ ales use sound and song to communicate across hundreds of miles of ocean .
this is , in fact , right here is the valley of l@@ has@@ a , right here in ti@@ bet .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all a@@ vid &quot; american i@@ do@@ l &quot; wat@@ chers .
and there was therefore this ti@@ cking clock , because gi@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ i was obviously out three months after that .
and in the particular example we have here , it &apos;s a film , &quot; twi@@ sted issues , &quot; and the first person says , &quot; now this is sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly a film . it fa@@ ils the google test mis@@ er@@ ably . &quot;
many businesses now , fortunately , have co@@ des of condu@@ ct and au@@ dit their supply cha@@ ins , but not every business . far from it .
it &apos;s only a couple do@@ zen square miles . it &apos;s in the rock@@ ies .
all these things are about en@@ ab@@ ling this idea of lin@@ king to the data .
so , what was the card ?
there &apos;s another tradition that thinks it &apos;s op@@ posed to this but accep@@ ts the worst assu@@ mption .
and you &apos;re all thinking what your neighb@@ ors would think of seeing that .
i &apos;ve recor@@ ded 4@@ 4@@ ,000 young people .
so i &apos;m going to show you another film .
it &apos;s just steel and ti@@ mber .
michael pri@@ t@@ ch@@ ard : okay .
we knew conser@@ vation would fail if it doesn &apos;t work to improve the lives of the local communities .
as i said , you can &apos;t deal with the environmental problem through exi@@ sting institutions .
if they did , how would we tell them what to do ?
they eat about one-@@ third , and the rest is ex@@ por@@ ted to all kinds of countries in europe and the rest of the world .
now this was 197@@ 3 .
so i started resear@@ ching , and to my surprise , this project had never been done before in the arts or the sci@@ ences .
&quot; he ate out , he saw shows , &quot; right ?
and that ro@@ ver will be more kind of like a chem@@ ist .
mor@@ e@@ over , they have the mechanis@@ ms to map all these sm@@ ells and to communicate about it .
already , i &apos;ll give you an example .
the tra@@ cks are el@@ ev@@ ated about eight feet from the water@@ line normally , but at that point the water had re@@ ce@@ ded to a level three or four feet below normal .
my colleagues , ira@@ va@@ th@@ am ma@@ ha@@ de@@ van and as@@ ko par@@ pol@@ a , have been making some head@@ way on this particular problem .
he wouldn &apos;t l@@ end him the money , and of course six months later ray cro@@ c had exactly the same idea .
so that &apos;s our job .
and is that even a nice thing to do ? is that a nice way to treat another human being , try and make them think something they don &apos;t want to think ?
this is interesting because this sle@@ eping machin@@ ery , it &apos;s perfectly conser@@ ved .
in this inti@@ mate talk fil@@ med at ted &apos;s off@@ ices , energy inno@@ v@@ ator am@@ ory lo@@ v@@ ins shows how to get the us off oil and coal by 20@@ 50 , $ 5 trillion che@@ aper , with no act of con@@ gress , led by business for profit . the key is integr@@ ating all four energ@@ y-@@ using sec@@ tors — and four kinds of innovation .
who are you playing ?
here , you can see where pun@@ ta tom@@ bo is , and they bre@@ ed in incredibly den@@ se col@@ on@@ ies .
so this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little .
he bu@@ ys a ring , she bu@@ ys a d@@ ress .
absolutely bo@@ g@@ gles my mind .
first of all , for ex@@ cep@@ tions , there are a lot of them and they &apos;re important .
so when you hear what i &apos;m going to talk about here today , first of all , i want to say that i am here on be@@ half of all the patients that i have ever met , all the ones i haven &apos;t met .
it happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed , and their brains are being speci@@ alized in something other than what is happening with their typical pe@@ ers .
yeah . i &apos;m also going to explain , a lot of people want to know where we got the name sle@@ ep@@ y man ban@@ jo boys from .
so the question is : can anything else happen ?
you can tell it &apos;s her . &quot; hell@@ o , this is syl@@ via brow@@ ne . &quot;
and we forget there is no progress without change .
so now , look at inner conditions . aren &apos;t they stron@@ ger ?
everybody knows that .
i knew i didn &apos;t have to hold up my paper of 28 out of 30 , but my satis@@ fac@@ tion was complete when he looked at me , puzz@@ led , and i thought to myself , &quot; smar@@ ter than the average bear , mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker . &quot;
because i was from the united king@@ dom , they thought the word nin@@ ja was a little too mean for children , so they decided to call it hero instead .
this is an origami figure -- one she@@ et , no cu@@ ts , fol@@ ding only , hundreds of fol@@ ds .
they had no stone tools .
so that in the terror@@ ist attac@@ ks of no@@ v@@ ember they were the first respon@@ der , and are now beginning to scale , because of partner@@ ship .
if you go on the streets of india and china , you see this kind of stuff .
my point now , though , is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here , if you &apos;ve survi@@ ved the ini@@ tial bl@@ ast .
we know that most of that wealth was made after the year 18@@ 00 .
that &apos;s when we &apos;re going to begin to use this knowledge to modi@@ fy ourselves .
so am@@ anda , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
so why is that ?
that &apos;s where dinosaurs began . that &apos;s where the radiation began .
it gives you great power@@ s .
if you think about the phone -- and in@@ tel has te@@ sted a lot of the things i &apos;m going to show you , over the last 10 years , in about 600 el@@ der@@ ly hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds -- 300 in ir@@ eland , and 300 in port@@ land -- trying to understand : how do we measure and monit@@ or behavior in a medi@@ cally meaning@@ ful way ?
these things are under attack around the world .
they &apos;re cl@@ inging to a rock face and actually sc@@ ra@@ ping bacteria off that rock face .
now , what &apos;s missing from the larger debate is a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive co@@ st-@@ benefit analysis between not fix@@ ing an un@@ healthy , environ@@ ment@@ ally challen@@ ged community , versus in@@ cor@@ por@@ ating struc@@ tural , sustainable changes .
&quot; the m@@ essen@@ ger went from paris to i@@ stan@@ bu@@ l . &quot;
everybody &apos;s got to work together -- china and the u.@@ s .
i speak as an auth@@ ority on that subject , because i &apos;m an extreme case .
michael was sent@@ enced to five years in prison .
and then i thought -- but here &apos;s the thing .
i &apos;ve spent my life working on sustain@@ ability .
and this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nur@@ ses and designers acting out a service scen@@ ari@@ o around patient care .
later , in the 18@@ 5@@ 0s , under president pi@@ er@@ ce , he was known to have re@@ mar@@ ked — probably the only thing he &apos;s known for — when a neighb@@ or passed by and said , &quot; i &apos;d love to see the beautiful house , &quot; and pi@@ er@@ ce said to him , &quot; why my de@@ ar sir , of course you may come in .
bill clin@@ ton : i want you to listen to me .
everybody could go and listen , you know -- ordinary people , even the su@@ l@@ tan , musli@@ ms and non-@@ musli@@ ms .
and you &apos;ll get slo@@ wer and slo@@ wer , until eventually you &apos;re back to running the same speed you were at age 19 .
the pro@@ tag@@ oni@@ sts of this story are a young woman , ro@@ se ma@@ pen@@ do , and her children .
i got on the phone and e@@ ma@@ iled to friends and colleagues .
but , every so often , we come across children who show some resi@@ du@@ al vision , and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treat@@ able .
this is a micro@@ flu@@ i@@ di@@ c chip that i developed .
3,000 employees . he kept every one of them on the pay@@ roll .
on@@ stage at ted@@ 20@@ 12 , jack cho@@ i demon@@ str@@ ates a powerful tool for training medical students : a stre@@ t@@ cher@@ -@@ si@@ zed multi-@@ touch screen of the human body that lets you explore , dis@@ se@@ ct and understand the body &apos;s parts and systems .
this is not a story of a nam@@ eless survi@@ vor of war , and nam@@ eless re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , whose stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical images we see in our new@@ spa@@ pers and our tv with tat@@ ter@@ ed clo@@ th@@ es , dir@@ ty face , sc@@ ared eyes .
and , i mean , there is a set of conditions .
now , imagine all that negative energy in there .
people say , &quot; oh my god , where are we going to get 8 billion ? &quot;
so , people of the ted community , i put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy .
we &apos;ve got about 75 percent of the fish , maybe as much as 90 percent .
so what &apos;s my wish ?
watch the fing@@ ers gra@@ b . the th@@ um@@ b comes up . wr@@ ist .
and then i &apos;m going to show you exactly what it is that you were re@@ acting to when you were re@@ acting to it .
the different particles are responsible for all the rich@@ ness in the world around us .
and then when i would run out of that story , i would imagine that wo@@ od@@ cu@@ tter &apos;s universe is one at@@ om in the a@@ x of another wo@@ od@@ cu@@ tter .
in addition , if your body size , if your b@@ m@@ i , your body mass inde@@ x , is above 30 -- if you &apos;re clin@@ ically ob@@ ese -- we also color@@ ed the dots yellow .
they appe@@ ared shor@@ tly after the dinosaurs disappe@@ ared , 65 million years ago , at a time when wh@@ ales still had legs , and they come from a re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous little pu@@ ffer fish fac@@ tion -- ob@@ lige me a little ki@@ pl@@ ing-@@ es@@ que story@@ telling here .
today , people in silicon valley and el@@ se@@ where speak of the i@@ its , the indian instit@@ utes of technology with the same rever@@ ence they used to accor@@ d to mit .
but the interesting thing about these computer virus infe@@ ctions was that , if you look at the rate at which the infe@@ ction worked , they show this spi@@ ky behavior that you &apos;re used to from a flu virus .
and so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in-@@ school project , the best one for a hou@@ se@@ hold project , or it could be the best community project for sustain@@ ability .
and , after all this , as the great chinese sage la@@ o t@@ zu said , &quot; gover@@ ning a great country is like cooking a small fish .
that is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
and maps are important devices for trans@@ fer@@ ring information , especially if you have human cognitive ability .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not possible to feed , clo@@ the and house us all and have us live de@@ cent lives .
i think if our students , if our high school students -- if all of the american citizens -- knew about prob@@ ability and statistics , we wouldn &apos;t be in the economic m@@ ess that we &apos;re in today .
and there &apos;s a patent pen@@ ding on these systems as well that &apos;s held by the community .
and nature is part of the gener@@ ator , the driver for this building .
we &apos;re at the beginning of a revolution , i hope , in the way we build , because this is the first new way to build a sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ per in probably 100 years or more .
of course , re@@ mot@@ eness in its normal sense , which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center , you get to re@@ mot@@ er areas .
and we are starting a bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal engineering program , so that we will train people lo@@ cally , who can re@@ pair that equipment .
that &apos;s what dri@@ ves my interest in projects like the tv series &quot; keeping sc@@ ore &quot; with the san francisco sym@@ ph@@ ony that looks at the back@@ stories of music , and working with the young musi@@ cians at the new world sym@@ ph@@ ony on projects that explore the potential of the new per@@ forming arts centers for both entertain@@ ment and education .
our diet consi@@ sts , &#91; in &#93; some part , of animal proteins , and at the moment , most of us here get it from li@@ ve@@ stock , from fish , from game .
these are the most primi@@ tive people in the world .
we &apos;ve looked at who &apos;s contribu@@ ted to lin@@ u@@ x , and most of the pat@@ ches have been produced by progra@@ mm@@ ers who &apos;ve only done one thing . &quot; right ?
&quot; poor people are reci@@ pi@@ ents . &quot;
anyone who &apos;s un@@ usually t@@ all , that &apos;s the first explan@@ ation we come up with .
no . there &apos;s serious issues in the region .
this picture is a typical seas@@ onal gras@@ s@@ land .
he was cou@@ gh@@ ing , cr@@ ying , blood sp@@ ill@@ ed on the street .
she went to the clin@@ ic , and they gave her antibio@@ tics and then sent her home .
you can see them over@@ la@@ pping .
and we said , &quot; well , that doesn &apos;t sound so much fun .
and i can find united states up there .
rules and in@@ centi@@ ves -- &quot; sti@@ cks &quot; and &quot; car@@ ro@@ ts . &quot;
just a few of them , but maybe you &apos;ll get just a little hin@@ t of some of these folks .
so just to conclu@@ de -- what are the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ home mes@@ sages from this ?
they do this maybe half a do@@ zen times before they get bor@@ ed , and then they go off and play in traffic .
the t@@ ar sands consu@@ me more water than any other oil process , three to five bar@@ rel@@ s of water are taken , pollu@@ ted and then re@@ turned into ta@@ il@@ ings pon@@ ds , the largest tox@@ ic im@@ po@@ und@@ ments on the planet .
so these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand .
so when we do listen to each other , it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably important for us to really test our listening skills , to really use our bodies as a res@@ on@@ ating cham@@ ber , to stop the jud@@ gment .
the british associ@@ ation would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to ad@@ mit women as full members .
so , with that little bit of technology , humans went from a small band of 10,000 or so -- the same number as ne@@ anderth@@ als everywhere -- and we suddenly explo@@ ded . with the invention of language around 5@@ 0,000 years ago , the number of humans explo@@ ded , and very quickly became the domin@@ ant species on the planet .
because in a photograph you can exam@@ ine a li@@ on &apos;s wh@@ is@@ kers without the fear of him ri@@ pping your face off .
w@@ right argu@@ es that technology has increas@@ ed the number of posi@@ tiv@@ e-@@ sum games that humans tend to be em@@ bro@@ iled in , by allo@@ wing the trade of goods , services and ideas over longer di@@ stances and among larger groups of people .
in spi@@ te of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
so , budd@@ ha &apos;s teaching has lost its moment@@ um .
my fre@@ el@@ ance job ended . and i had to get a ful@@ l-@@ time job to pay the bil@@ ls .
that is the cancer of deser@@ ti@@ fication that we do not recognize ti@@ ll its ter@@ min@@ al form .
this is mo@@ i . this is in the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an ama@@ zon .
well let me show you a story of what i mean by &quot; really sti@@ cking with us . &quot;
so one day i was in my room and i saw this thing sitting in my room and i thought it was a mon@@ ster .
and most importantly , he lo@@ an@@ ed me the head of research for the h@@ ein@@ z company .
from a teenager , i &apos;m trans@@ formed into my current self .
and 100 pages later .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a sub@@ set of the elements in the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table .
well , we can learn a lot because our education systems are fail@@ ing des@@ per@@ ately in many ways .
now , i had friends in the u.@@ s .
aug@@ mented reality is just the lat@@ est technology .
they didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
read ma@@ x bo@@ on .
but a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on dat@@ ab@@ ases , often sitting in their computers , and actually , currently not shared .
&quot; it just is what it is . &quot;
yes , to be sure , science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .
and i have no idea why there &apos;s two , and that &apos;s something i want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light , but it can see red light .
because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most .
tomorrow , pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i is speaking . i love pa@@ ol@@ a .
5 : 10 .
please visit one at this address .
walked into the le@@ go store .
he was dying of leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a and he knew it , and he de@@ dic@@ ated this con@@ cer@@ to to his wife , di@@ ta , who was her@@ self a conc@@ ert pian@@ ist .
essentially , i could wea@@ ve a bunch of these anti@@ bodies into a network of carbon nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes such that you have a network that only re@@ acts with one protein , but also , due to the properties of these nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , it would change its electrical properties based on the amount of protein present .
and then we understand what is ter@@ ro@@ ir .
expan@@ sive listening , on the other hand , is listening &quot; with , &quot; not listening &quot; for . &quot;
but you see a lot of small spo@@ ts in this picture .
now an impro@@ vis@@ er senses and plays the next cool move , but a com@@ pos@@ er is consi@@ der@@ ing all possible moves , testing them out , pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing them out , until he sees how they can form a powerful and co@@ her@@ ent design of ulti@@ mate and en@@ during cool@@ ness .
or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a ligh@@ t@@ ning call .
my wish is that ted as@@ s@@ ist us in our work and help us to build a high-@@ quality rural health system in a poor country , r@@ wand@@ a , that can be a model for africa , and indeed , for any poor country anywhere in the world .
when mu@@ ti is asked , &quot; why do you condu@@ ct like this ? &quot;
it &apos;s like a looking glass into a hidden world .
we call it &quot; atmosphere . &quot; this is the ic@@ on of our journey .
there are two cli@@ ps i want to show you , the first one is a kind of ho@@ d@@ ge@@ po@@ dge , its just three little moments , four little moments with three of the people who are here ton@@ ight .
and to make it a bit simpl@@ er for myself , i decided to map out a scientific cri@@ teri@@ a . and here it is .
scientists have been studying in recent years the phenomenon that they often describe as flow , that the design of our systems , whether natural or social , chan@@ nel the flow of whatever runs through them .
and it &apos;s a -- it &apos;s a powerful and em@@ power@@ ing tool .
these are , indeed , the chr@@ onic dis@@ orders of young people .
but ju@@ dge rus@@ sell did have an alternative .
he &apos;s at the top of the american middle class .
it per@@ forms about equi@@ val@@ ently to a system that &apos;s in the order of 100,000 dollars .
how would we write the treat@@ y to do that ?
i tried everything . i went to kin@@ ok@@ uni@@ ya .
these land@@ -@@ use decisions created the ho@@ sti@@ le conditions that lead to problems like o@@ bes@@ ity , diabetes and as@@ th@@ ma .
he &apos;s an amazing man .
it &apos;s the same in marketing .
but unfortunately , c@@ cam@@ l@@ r , the regi@@ onal com@@ mission in charge of conser@@ ving and man@@ aging fish sto@@ cks and other living marine resources , is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has auth@@ ori@@ zed the expan@@ sion of to@@ o@@ th@@ fish fis@@ her@@ ies in the region .
and what m@@ yo@@ d essentially does is , it causes cells to differ@@ enti@@ ate into muscle cells . so this com@@ po@@ und , m@@ yo@@ d , has been te@@ sted on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually conver@@ t this variety of cell types into skelet@@ al muscle cells .
the pack has got to be able to s@@ wal@@ low its e@@ go , be co@@ oper@@ ative and pull together .
i worked a lot of late ni@@ ghts . i worked a lot of wee@@ ken@@ ds , and i found myself never having time for all the projects that i wanted to work on on my own .
they have di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed millions of books .
