there &apos;s a similar story for my electricity consumption , where switching off the dvd players , the stere@@ os , the computer peripher@@ als that were on all the time , and just switching them on when i needed them , knocked another third off my electricity bills too .
we changed it to social diseases and people came along with ac@@ ne and spots , but nobody came with v@@ d any more .
we start with these fragments , and then we have a hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combination system that reas@@ se@@ m@@ bles those into a chromosome .
thank you .
because we don &apos;t see how conflicts of interest work on us .
there &apos;s a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical .
ao : what did you do with it , derek ?
when jamie he@@ ywood &apos;s brother was diagnosed with als , he devoted his life to fighting the disease as well . the he@@ ywood brothers built an ingenious website where people share and track data on their illnesses -- and they discovered that the collective data had enormous power to comfort , explain and predict .
imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard , a mouse , a screen .
but it is strange .
thank you .
and then , of course , they were used by extremi@@ sts and politicians on the other side .
we took him out to the kennedy space center , up inside the nasa vehicle , into the back of the zero-@@ g airplane .

ok , now , i &apos;m not hyp@@ noti@@ zing you , i &apos;m merely placing you in a hei@@ ghten@@ ed state of synchron@@ ic@@ ity , so our minds are along the same lines .
then they had to bring them in .
there is no short@@ cut : it is like swimming by swimming .
this is an area way outside the national park , stre@@ tching out into all these very degraded lands .
now i put my sister on my back -- burning -- and i walked 10 kilometers with her stra@@ pped on my back .

and she &apos;s going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face , wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach .
now -- -- so we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside super@@ conduc@@ tors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields , such as needed in mri machines , particle acceler@@ ators and so on .
i checked the reports on this one .
and this is not a rhetor@@ ical question .
it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world , but many people believe that it &apos;s the most beautiful .
i &apos;ll leave it at that , thank you very much .
thank you for listening to me today .
some of you haven &apos;t fired them yet .
for me , this story begins about 15 years ago , when i was a ho@@ spi@@ ce doctor at the university of chicago .
and i was from the same area to him .
i said , &quot; no , i can &apos;t use my legs . &quot;
we need to put this better market feedback .
and perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfe@@ ction and seren@@ ity meant that something new had to happen -- a radical new move , which in 1@@ 600 is what did happen .
the top half is el@@ mer &apos;s wood glue .
its banking sector was 10 times the gdp of the rest of the economy .
how many are there in the human genome ? three billion .
this is about food and water , soil and climate , the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives .
so it &apos;s a single calculation for every single component of the building that we &apos;re adding onto .
but they &apos;re doing what they &apos;re told , and what they &apos;re being told to do is wrong .
ela@@ sti@@ city of mind is something that we really need , you know , we really need , we really cher@@ ish and we really work on .
and you get in a car , and you drive away , and 10-@@ minute drive , and you get out , and no one gives a rat &apos;s who you are .
i &apos;ve been privileged to see so much of our beautiful earth and the people and creatures that live on it .
i was frightened of her . i felt like a child .
i &apos;d like to conclude by rel@@ ating all of what i &apos;ve said to the term &quot; beauty . &quot;
when the baby popped up , it was filled with blu@@ e-@@ green tissues .
i need to go to the mall , and you know your father now , he takes a na@@ p in the afternoon , and i got to go .
the journey from a small weather station on the north coast of siberia up to my final starting point , the edge of the pack ice , the coast of the arctic ocean , took about five hours , and if anyone watched fear@@ less fe@@ li@@ x baum@@ gar@@ tner going up , rather than just coming down , you &apos;ll appreciate the sense of app@@ re@@ hen@@ sion , as i sat in a helicopter th@@ under@@ ing north , and the sense , i think if anything , of im@@ pen@@ ding do@@ om .
some people see a dal@@ mati@@ an dog .
i speak only english , they speak only italian , so we had no way to communicate .
and when people start talking about privilege , they get paralyzed by shame .
alan kay : they &apos;ve got little stop@@ watches .
we &apos;d also made cricket the only sport in india , which is a pity , but in india every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
she looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing water@@ she@@ ds , fore@@ stry resources , fisheries , and discovered that yes , in case after case , humans destroyed the commons that they depended on .
it may be that we live in an endless universe , both in space and in time .
so i thought , okay , fine , i &apos;ve got empathy , or empathy , at any rate , is what &apos;s critical to this kind of interview .
you know , because they can &apos;t hear the s@@ nor@@ ing anymore .
so listen to two mothers speaking mother@@ ese -- the universal language we use when we talk to kids -- first in english and then in japanese .
now , you &apos;re going to be deciding how you &apos;re going to lose money , but you &apos;re going to get the same choice .
everybody sitting in a basket , and i was on top of the balloon , ready to slide down with my sky@@ sur@@ f board .
and once you have been under fire yourself , it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some mach@@ o instrument to bra@@ g about .
we &apos;d put them in an environment where they didn &apos;t want to be , and they didn &apos;t want to do what we wanted them to do .
she was trying to for@@ ce-@@ feed me . she &apos;s pushing me around .
and even though a hundred teams were there , these cars went nowhere .
i want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic , because it really is a problem .
that doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s the vegetables or the olive oil .
fg : no . not now either .
less petro@@ l stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising .
when you take away everything that he ever learned in this world , his naked heart still sh@@ ines .
it actually improves it .
first of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule .
and i decided about that time , about age 10 , that it would be really cool if i was a test driver .
i know i &apos;m over time .
this matrix self-@@ assem@@ bles , growing through and around the particles , making millions and millions of tiny fibers .
and i should know , because during the time i atten@@ ded that school , a military take@@ over happened in my country , a gun@@ man of my nation@@ ality nearly killed the po@@ pe , and turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; euro@@ vision song contest .
we are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world , and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage .
automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is sub@@ conscious , controlled by the behavioral side .
this is how i stand up for myself .
a gecko can support its entire body weight with one to@@ e .
these are both real objects .
his mission and his message is about the ar@@ av@@ ind eye care system .
in my work with cattle , i noticed a lot of little things that most people don &apos;t notice would make the cattle bal@@ k . like , for example , this flag wa@@ ving , right in front of the veter@@ inary facility .
so this is the system that i &apos;m talking about , off the west coast . it &apos;s coinci@@ dent with the tecton@@ ic plate , the juan de fu@@ ca tecton@@ ic plate .
this is age versus cost of health care .
he says , &quot; ok , but what is the name of that block ? &quot;
in the u.s. alone , a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings .
it &apos;s hard to believe , when you look at this , that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash .
he &apos;s been up to that point in 14 war zones so he &apos;s posi@@ tioned to make better judgments , perhaps , than people who have never done that kind of work .
and you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants , what it needs .
his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work .
it &apos;s groups like that in this room that generate the future of the u.s. economy .
and we have the el@@ ves in the form of china .
so based on the research by mar@@ cel@@ o co@@ el@@ ho from mit , hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conduc@@ tive fabric and ink .
thanks .
in the summer of love , in 1967 , two million people , children , died of smallpox .
we should have preferences that lead us into one future over another .
communal value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggregate of shared , publicly available data , whether it &apos;s photos on flickr or videos on youtube or whatever .
but it turns out , it doesn &apos;t remind me of the thing i thought it would ; it reminds me constantly of something else instead .
we need to deliver health care , not in large institutions , but close to people &apos;s homes , and we need to deliver health care using whoever is available and affordable in our local communities .
we owe it to our children , our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along .
dr. mul@@ lis was talking about his experiments , and i realized that i almost became a scientist .
and we fall asleep -- and i &apos;ve been in this room , you know , for a couple of months now .
the holy man , black el@@ k , said , &quot; i did not know then how much was ended .
now the ship sank between robben island to the south and das@@ sen island to the north .
at such moments , our selves are complete .
after his lecture , a student got up and said to him , &quot; give us a poem . &quot;
and that problem is , &quot; how is it so easy to know other minds ? &quot;
so this means that in a place with a lot of aids , there &apos;s a really significant cost of sex .
and so people love to form their opinions .
you see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
now wait a minute , we heard about a guy in florida .
but in fact , what they said was , &quot; leave doug and come down yourself .
and he said , &quot; son , it goes on forever . &quot;
i live right there in the west village , so the plu@@ me was luckily blowing west , away from us .
and the molas there , you can find them with a spo@@ tter plane very easily , and they like to hang out under floating ra@@ fts of kel@@ p .
a lot of people ask me , how did i make these ?
and i couldn &apos;t even see the monkeys that they were getting with these dar@@ ts .
you know , you once wrote , i like this quote , &quot; if by some magic , autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth , then men would still be soci@@ alizing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave . &quot;
it was to work with 3,000 offen@@ ders split into three co@@ hor@@ ts of 1,000 each .
this is real , tangible change , real , tangible change .
the mycelium inf@@ uses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it &apos;s extremely ten@@ acious .
and , all right , i &apos;m kind of mil@@ king the metaphor a little bit .
so , what it does , it has three legs . it &apos;s probably difficult to see , but it has a win@@ ch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot .
he has to have po@@ ise .
ju@@ arez : you &apos;ve heard of the border -- one of the most dangerous borders in the world .
and this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast hump@@ backs .
qualit@@ a@@ tively and quanti@@ ta@@ tively , they choose exactly the same way as people , when tested in the same thing .
my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge , and during the year and a half i was on cru@@ tches , it became a sort of symbol to me .
now there is something else , though , in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated .
so , let me finish by saying that we &apos;ve thought about this as a kind of engineering problem .
the really scary things though are the physical , chemical , ocean@@ ographic things that are happening .
and experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math , interact with it , feel it .
suddenly we have the dynamic in@@ consisten@@ cy that puzz@@ led us .
and my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pon@@ g game , like this one .
that &apos;s multi-touch , controlling a device by touching its display .
we can do it within 10 years , and if we do succeed , we will send to ted , in 10 years , a h@@ olog@@ ram to talk to you . thank you .
i feel a bit about it like i did about a very strict math teacher that i once had at school .
let &apos;s see how .
in others , ko@@ sher and hal@@ al meat are being banned , as we speak .
and to make sure you didn &apos;t realize , or didn &apos;t en@@ act their capabilities as general purpose computing devices , they also made it illegal for you to try to res@@ et the copy@@ ability of that content .
and these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about .
and this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area .
one of my favorite : it &apos;s 40 below , you &apos;ve got to go to the bathroom , where are you going to go and how are you going to do it ?
other ones are historical .
so i went undercover as a man who was interested in this particular business , of course .
one of the students asked a question that just war@@ med my heart .
but i &apos;m slowly coming to this horri@@ fying realization that my students just might not be learning anything .
this is in war@@ saw .
these things just get him really excited . and so we &apos;re looking at these concepts , and we were just like , whoa , this guy &apos;s good .
extract geometry from the images .
did you know that in all the states where there is no sha@@ ding that people who are gay , les@@ bian , bis@@ ex@@ ual or trans@@ gen@@ dered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay , les@@ bian , bis@@ ex@@ ual or trans@@ gen@@ dered ?
he said , &quot; thank you . we had a baby . &quot; i said , &quot; congratu@@ lations . &quot;
it &apos;s not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience .
all right , so , i &apos;ve got a metr@@ on@@ ome , and it &apos;s the world &apos;s smallest metr@@ on@@ ome , the -- well , i shouldn &apos;t adverti@@ se .
and with every open source project , the real benefit is the inter@@ play between the specific concerns of people custom@@ izing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns .
and so , coming directly from there to here .
it &apos;s a story about transformation and connections .
at all .
the first lesson is about that design can change not just your product .
it &apos;s a corruption relative to the fra@@ mers &apos; baseline for this republic .
and of course , the des@@ ired range -- trying to keep glucose between 75 and less than 200 , checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor -- you &apos;ll see how that can impact diabetes .
and a month into it , i come to the office , and i have this email from one of our students .
later on , i earned an mba at stanford .
but that sure started me thinking about various things , and immediately , we began making a solar-@@ powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world , we didn &apos;t want the small funding in the government to be decre@@ ased , which is what the government was trying to do with it .
i realized that people like me , girls with skin the color of chocolate , whose kin@@ ky hair could not form pon@@ y@@ tails , could also exist in literature .
who loves the wedding almost as much as the bri@@ de ?
we take this same moving protocell here , and we put it in another experiment , get it moving . then i &apos;m going to add some food to the system , and you &apos;ll see that in blue here , right ?
and if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future , you will constantly leave your ro@@ se-@@ tin@@ ted spectac@@ les on .
but of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a bmw or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
and when i worked in the prison system , it was so clear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that i worked with on death row , the seeds of their own compassion had never been wat@@ ered .
but scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible .
and the reason that being able to predict those things is important , is not just because you might run a he@@ dge fund and make money off of it , but because if you can predict what people will do , you can engineer what they will do .
it wasn &apos;t until we really left earth , got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a limited condition .
and speaking of values , i &apos;ve noticed that in the discussion about moral persu@@ asi@@ on online , and when i &apos;m talking with people , more often than not there is a weird bias .
it matters because this is a democracy .
but if you could put a pin in most cities , and imagine how far you could , if you had the time , walk in one half-@@ hour , it &apos;s the city .
so during the course of the day , five different smells are disper@@ sed throughout that environment .
she gives you the names of your guardian angels , that &apos;s first .
we have various strategies -- there &apos;s the meth@@ us@@ el@@ ah mouse prize , which is basically an incentive to innovate , and to do what you think is going to work , and you get money for it if you win .
these ideas are well known in liberal academic circles , but c@@ ler@@ gy like myself have been reluctant to air them , for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities , for fear of up@@ setting the simple faith of more traditional belie@@ vers .
it &apos;s almost like leaving congress .
we are living on a planet with a lot of activities , with reference to our living environment , done by faith and guess alone .
american education is so expensive .
well , we had a party . this is africa -- we have good parties in africa . and last month , they threw a surprise party for me .
and i went from what &apos;s called real numbers , which are points on a line , to imaginary , complex numbers , which are points on a plane , which is what one should do there , and this shape came out .
you can see it for yourself . there are colors , street@@ lights , new pa@@ vement with no po@@ th@@ ol@@ es , trees . so it &apos;s beautiful ; it &apos;s safe . &quot;
and of course , this task has material dimensions .
i was so struck by this comment that from then on , i started to offer all the participants those seven so@@ das , and i asked them , &quot; how many choices are these ? &quot;
nasa described conditions that year as the worst since records began .
india is approaching . the first african countries coming into the western box , and we get a lot a new neighbors .
so , &quot; red wine can help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
so effectively it &apos;s the first time there &apos;s been competition for this monopoly , because the utili@@ ties have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines , but now it &apos;s on your roof .
and howard looked at their product line , and he said , what you have is a dead tomato society .
and he opened the door and we walked into a win@@ dow@@ less 20-@@ by-@@ 20-@@ foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling , and cra@@ mmed on every shelf his collection of may@@ an ceram@@ ics .
but that &apos;s not always the case .
it certainly doesn &apos;t cost as much as oil , and it &apos;s pl@@ enti@@ ful , as i hope that you &apos;ve been able to see from the photographs .
from here to here is the wavelength of sound .
so , what i want to do here in the few minutes i have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
there &apos;s somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it &apos;s the illumin@@ ati or the bilder@@ ber@@ gers .
the -- the whole world underneath me .
now , prototypes speed up the process of innovation , because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weak@@ nesses .
we clearly have to be large , compared to atoms , to have layer upon layer of complex structure .
i always say to my partner , mar@@ is@@ a gar@@ din@@ i , who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen .
he said , &quot; don &apos;t all those little tweets , don &apos;t all those little si@@ ps of online communication , add up to one big gul@@ p of real conversation ? &quot;
and what shar@@ ps means is needles , things that stick .
let me leave you with a final thought .
well , i myself have spent the past 30 years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of computation seriously .
so they ended up an iron age european society , virtually unable to make their own iron . a second item on my checklist is climate change . climate can get warmer or col@@ der or dr@@ yer or wetter .
you don &apos;t need that much up there .
calculating was typically the limit@@ ing step , and now often it isn &apos;t .
i mean , there &apos;s water in beer .
but you know , sort of &quot; our brains have been manipulated ; we &apos;re all addi@@ cts . &quot;
but let &apos;s face it , the secretary of state doesn &apos;t know much about iran .
studies say that tens of thousands of american grandmothers , grand@@ fathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
and there were three old ladies who lived in -- that &apos;s her self-@@ built house behind her -- and they &apos;ve lived there for 30 or 40 years , and they are the back@@ bone of the community there .
and that usually , if you &apos;re a bit extraordinary , if you &apos;re not exactly of human appearance , then people will feel in@@ clin@@ ed to participate and to feel out loud .
because this is the magic : you load the laundry , and what do you get out of the machine ?
which is to say , the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts , if you &apos;ve got all three .
i had a 24-@@ kar@@ at gold ring .
there were some people who were a little less impressed .
what i found out is that the tool@@ ing , if you interven@@ ed in the software , actually produced decor@@ ative effects .
when i was perhaps six years old , i went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother .
and i said , &quot; you know what ? these apples come from your ancestors , and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .
and for the most part try to stop them from making this argument .
imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their google glasses or , one day , their contact lenses , and use seven or eight data points about you to in@@ fer anything else which may be known about you .
so the question is : what do we do next ?
that &apos;s reason number one . and reason number two : it &apos;s much easier for the camera guy to film if i &apos;m using smoke .
as you &apos;re thinking , this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market . right ?
but when climate became , politically , a hot topic -- if i may make the pu@@ n -- in the last 15 years , this became so un-@@ pc , we couldn &apos;t talk about it .
here is the business case for sustainability .
and you say , &quot; my god , if this is my mom , how come i &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
like half the antibiotics in this country are not admini@@ stered to people , but to animals .
they pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean .
what i &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .
i was ending middle school , starting high school -- i &apos;m a sop@@ hom@@ ore now — and i was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you &apos;re told you can &apos;t be when you &apos;re growing up as a girl .
why does goliath not react to that ?
i want to talk today only about autonomy .
this was done in japan and in the u.s. , published at the same time , and it re@@ boot@@ ed skin cells into stem cells , last year .
so this stuff is not that hard , right ?
david mc@@ cand@@ less : chocolate .
and that &apos;s an i@@ co@@ sa@@ he@@ dron , which is one of the five sacred soli@@ ds , very important shapes .
it gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
what is it ? is that jackson pollock ? &quot;
but of@@ ten@@ times they &apos;ll ci@@ te distra@@ ctions .
i would predict , if you &apos;re a representative sample , that many more of you in@@ sure your iphones than your lives , even when you have kids .
i &apos;m your worst nightmare . i &apos;m your daddy and your mom@@ my .
it &apos;s fallen by half .
cali@@ ban : hast thou not dropped from heaven ?
so basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm .
now that &apos;s the tro@@ pic of cancer in the north and the tro@@ pic of cap@@ ri@@ corn in the south , that much i knew , but i was surprised to learn this little fact : those are not carto@@ gra@@ phers &apos; lines , like la@@ titude or the borders between nations , they are astronomical phenomena caused by the earth &apos;s ti@@ lt , and they change .
i know theater un@@ ites us .
you &apos;re allowed to hate these people .
how do we know that ?
they &apos;re not magic . they are not our parents .
everyone knew who i was , so i thought i was a pretty big deal , and i was protected , and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail , i had an amazing mom who was just fier@@ c@@ ely independent .
and in western europe mostly try to stay away from any long-@@ distance relationships , big grou@@ p@@ ings , grou@@ p@@ ings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families .
what i hope you can see is that the molecules are related .
the thought that you wouldn &apos;t want to transfer electric power wir@@ elessly , no one ever thought of that .
it &apos;s called programming .
fiber : nex@@ t-@@ generation way of communicating .
and that &apos;s really clear now .
i believe we can build architec@@ tures online to make such human requests that much easier to do , to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor and impact , and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it .
the higgs , over here on the left , has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electro@@ weak pattern .
and do you know what , that might be enough .
the philosophy is very simple .
but ultimately , i decided that what i really ought to do is not fight being who i am , but embrace it .
i &apos;m working a lot with motion and animation , and also i &apos;m an old dj and a musician .
he said , &quot; well , i didn &apos;t have a question so much as i had a suggestion . &quot;
they &apos;ve come together .
good ! alex garden says , &quot; to be successful put your nose down in something and get damn good at it . &quot;
on the right , also , we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going .
but the people getting into these city lea@@ gues were people who were taking their cues from the west .
patients ad@@ mitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have reno@@ v@@ ated along with four other clinics , complete with solar power gener@@ ators , good lab technology .
you wonder , are these things random chance ?
and it was the now director of the entire piece of the veteran &apos;s administration -- who , himself , had lost an arm 39 years ago in vietnam -- who was ad@@ am@@ antly opposed to these crazy devices that don &apos;t work .
unemployment up . housing values down . equity markets down .
people re@@ use it for a s@@ lab for their home .
so it does play a social role , however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement .
we see all this complexity .
he was an exact contemporary of demo@@ sth@@ enes .
again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most , and perhaps because of the but@@ ler lie ambi@@ gui@@ ties i was telling you about .
because it &apos;s the feeling of a broken relationship .
having a great attitude is about choosing option number two , and choosing , no matter how difficult it is , no matter what pain hits you , choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future .
he wants to get your cookies .
which is a tragedy because there are emplo@@ yers who can use pools of very flexible local people boo@@ ked completely ad ho@@ c around when that person wants to work .
so it &apos;s a li@@ tt@@ le-@@ appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .
it was purch@@ ased the year i was born , and it was extraordinary , because i did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information .
how do you build a wheelchair ready to bla@@ ze through mud and sand , all for under $ 200 ? mit engineer am@@ os winter gui@@ des us through the mechanics of an all-@@ terrain wheelchair that &apos;s cheap and easy to build -- for true accessi@@ bility -- and gives us some lessons he learned along the road .
you go to che@@ z pan@@ isse , they give you the red-@@ tail sas@@ himi with ro@@ ast@@ ed pump@@ kin seeds in a something something reduction .
and this thing is the second vor@@ tex to be built in the world , in a two-@@ and-a-half meter drop on a river .
i &apos;m going to carry on with this kind of journalism , because i know that when evil men destroy , good men must build and bind .
it was huge . to give you a sense of the scale , okay , there you go . the scale here is 50 miles on top , a hundred kilometers on the bottom . this thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that ex@@ cav@@ ated out vast amounts of earth that splas@@ hed around the globe and set fires all over the planet , threw up enough dust to block out the sun .
but with sarah bro@@ sn@@ an we started out with ca@@ pu@@ chin monkeys .
contemporary artists in india are having a conversation with the world like never before .

anybody feels threatened , anybody really need it ?
every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell , and they &apos;re part of the fea@@ ther .
you miss the real patterns . you don &apos;t want to be too skeptical .
there &apos;s really very little point in listening to music when it doesn &apos;t sound good to you .
one of the great iron@@ ies of modern food systems is that they &apos;ve made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder .
and there &apos;s a lot to be overwhelmed about , to be fair -- an environmental crisis , wealth dispar@@ ity in this country unlike we &apos;ve seen since 19@@ 28 , and globally , a totally im@@ moral and ongoing wealth dispar@@ ity .
and basically , we lived for all those years , and some might argue that we still do , in a situation of being on the br@@ ink , literally , of an apocalyp@@ tic , planetary cal@@ am@@ ity .
they were killing people . they were doing whatever they want because they have power .
and there are a lot of similarities between the internet and the electric industry .
a lot of data . but there &apos;s no theory . there &apos;s a little , wi@@ mp@@ y box on top there .
take all of that data , combine it , and this map is what you get .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot;
and my story is about these tra@@ de@@ offs .
what &apos;s happened in the music world is there &apos;s a culture or an ecosystem that &apos;s been created that , if you take some words from apple , the cat@@ ch@@ phrase that we create , rip , mix and burn .
and by this time i was hooked .
the reason that i avoi@@ ded an mba program -- other than the fact that i couldn &apos;t get into any because i had a 6@@ 1 percent average out of high school and then 6@@ 1 percent average at the only school in canada that accepted me , car@@ lton -- but our mba programs don &apos;t teach kids to be entrepreneurs .
new models for pe@@ dago@@ gy for the displaced .

fe@@ ma and the state will pay 85 percent of the cost of a feder@@ ally declared disaster , leaving the town to pay last 15 percent of the bill .
so , to get off the tree , i began to use my old computers .
so we combined these needs with technology &apos;s themes .
and what i &apos;d like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleas@@ hed when someone is in a survival situation , how the will to survive can bring that out in people .
others will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math that have helped us get a better handle on the world , and other folk will talk about periods when there was a deep flourishing of the arts and sciences . so this debate will go on and on .
but this was spo@@ tted by an e@@ ag@@ le-@@ eye investi@@ gator , and he was convicted .
and i announced i wanted to be a sculp@@ tor in paris .
chris ab@@ ani tells stories of people : people standing up to soldiers . people being compassionate . people being human and recla@@ iming their humanity . it &apos;s &quot; ubuntu , &quot; he says : the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me .
but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year .
so you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic , you have computer programming , you have gram@@ mar , you have genetics , all based off of that core of , if you know this and that , now you &apos;re ready for this next concept .
i slowly became aware that i knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year .
and if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re floo@@ ded with these neuro@@ transmit@@ ters that are really good at in@@ ducing learning and plasti@@ city , and the inhi@@ bit@@ ory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
i wrote the book i needed to read .
eight-@@ digit capacity -- don &apos;t you hate that ?
actually , hiv &apos;s about sex and drugs , and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational , they are erec@@ tions and addiction .
but to go on , here is a very good example to see .
the medi@@ cs amongst you , if there are any , will recognize the first two .
however , what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
but , as you can see , the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and inter@@ t@@ wine in a very interesting shape , interesting structure .

for a moment , what i need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination .

the fundamental forms of fern@@ s followed , to bear spor@@ es that fores@@ ha@@ do@@ wed seeds .
the minister of education down south in london described himself as a &quot; big fan . &quot;
there &apos;s over 10 million people , probably 20 million people , largely volunteers , who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internation@@ ally-@@ coordinated operation in peace@@ time .
music for me was more than a passion . it was obsession .
it takes only one and a half days to cross the atlantic ocean .
maybe he &apos;s worried that he &apos;s going bald .
new models that extend long periods of time are hard .
it means challenging what we take for granted , things that we think are obvious .
and you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain .
the energy in all living things , at@@ p , is phosphor@@ us-@@ based .
and if you had an injured organ , if you had a heart attack and we wanted to repair that injured area , do you want those robust , pl@@ enti@@ ful stem cells on the top ?
and from a design perspective , it &apos;s about understanding what you can dele@@ gate to technology and what you can dele@@ gate to other people .
it &apos;s a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world .
for me , it was a year@@ long street fight .
but more importantly , focus and you can achieve .
we hear a lot about china , and they do l@@ end a lot of money , but 60 percent of the f@@ di in the last couple of years has come from europe , america , australia , canada .
if you &apos;re inside , find a window and look out of it .
this is it being held in the hand .
and a beautiful example of this i found , actually , when i visited a colleague of mine in japan , professor ku@@ ro@@ ka@@ wa .
and what i heard , it kind of distur@@ bed me .
i &apos;ve got to say , one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to , and i want to introduce you to one of those .
but it &apos;s not only about the front page .
it &apos;s unclear to me how they actually sor@@ ted these three of them out .
van@@ nev@@ ar bush was the u.s. government &apos;s chief scientific advis@@ er during the war .
and , in principle , it could &apos;ve gone on forever , with perfect ce@@ li@@ bac@@ y on the part of the ho@@ sts .
you don &apos;t have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the bar@@ ra@@ cks .
you know , every saturday and sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadi@@ ums to watch games .
that &apos;s the weird side coming out again , and a lot of companies don &apos;t understand that .
my parents were totally stressed out about me going and audi@@ tioning and traveling and performing all over the place , but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be pre@@ occupied with my own mortality all of the time .
and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
shame is an epidemic in our culture .
the only problem is : potatoes , if you think about it , look pretty disgusting .
it may decline some more .
and we need to figure out how to cultivate xen@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
that &apos;s why the same between the before and after that this shows , it &apos;s hard to see the difference .
you have to do it . africans have to do it , in con@@ junction with everyone else .
in that moment in time , mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-@@ apartheid rainbow nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
so in theory , you could grow any organ from any one of your cells .
because it &apos;s scary and it &apos;s expensive , but we need to have it , ok ?
it is fatty , it &apos;s sweet , it &apos;s sil@@ ky , it &apos;s un@@ ctu@@ ous .
in those times documents had hard covers , they were filled in by hand , and they stated your job .
dr : no , i don &apos;t think so .
in 1984 , we did the first so-called &quot; green office &quot; in america for environmental defense .
ok , i want you to pin@@ ch right here with two fingers and your thumb .
in the united states we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
he got his name from fighting stark naked .
so even though it &apos;s a global company , they take a very local approach .
so he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people , not just a few people .
i mean , today , one person speaking can be seen by millions , she@@ dding bright light on potent ideas , creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case , intense desire to laugh .
and in effect , what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot , and they &apos;re going to move that back and forward .
and he whi@@ pped out his cellphone , di@@ aled the number , and a voice said , &quot; i &apos;m up here . &quot;
if he slept one hour , 30 people would die .
how do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data , psychological data , relational data , in and on and around the home ?
and with this , we can get the sk@@ inn@@ y on our psychological happen@@ ings and build a story of our behaviors over time .
and we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together , these really quite unprece@@ dent@@ edly complex cooperative mechanisms .
and it won &apos;t make a lot of sense now .
but my work wasn &apos;t just about the research .
but there was another population that was affected -- the 40,000 fet@@ uses in uter@@ o during the siege .
what happens is that you set the tag to deta@@ ch from the shark after a fixed period , in this case it was eight months , and literally to the day the tag popped off , dri@@ fted up , said hello to the satellite and sent , not all the data , but enough data for us to use .
i started mixing , and i felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another , but i just kept on going .
when identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
she wouldn &apos;t have wanted me to , i would think .
most of the time is kind of sitting there .
what is this ant doing ? what is this in aid of ?
but i think , as integration of exponential technologies , this is the example .
br : one of the really cool things about the lab , besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen , is that , you know , with this new equipment , and this new approach , all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open , and so the experiments and the food and the dishes that we created , they just kept going further and further out there .
i mean , europe once , of course , once command@@ ed the future in its confidence .
text : &quot; there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you . &quot;
so , what you &apos;re seeing here is a wonderful presentation , but it &apos;s one of the t@@ ours .
when you think what &apos;s happened to financial services , and you see what &apos;s happened to the economy , you think , &quot; well , there is a man who delivers on his promises . &quot;
there &apos;s plenty of resource . you can make it reliable .
she went to high school .
that &apos;s actually an optimistic observation , because it suggests that if human beings are the agents of cultural destruction , we can also be , and must be , the facili@@ tat@@ ors of cultural survival .
that means you , your neighbor , your cellphone , the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to com@@ press it down to the size of the schwarz@@ schild radius .
in a goth@@ ic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
there is great con@@ fusion when the two look at each other .
thank you .
you know , bob &apos;s that berkeley tech@@ ie type who started sy@@ base .
and i don &apos;t mean he made lego that looked like a s@@ lot machine ; i mean he made a s@@ lot machine out of lego .
now to put some neuro@@ biological meat on this abstract model , we constructed a simple one-@@ dimensional world for our favorite subject , fruit flies .
and in real life , there are lots of non-zero-sum games .
so , yeah , so this is again difficult .
you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community .
and one thing we should all understand is that we are brut@@ ally honest with search engines .
some people will find very scary . i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to proje@@ c@@ tile pu@@ ke on me , but that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;d jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the dri@@ ve@@ way , and it was a blast .
i &apos;d never really memor@@ i@@ alized myself .
unfortunately , what is far@@ med ends up as what we eat .
we know about the end of oil .
what &apos;s the point of these radio waves that you &apos;ve found ? &quot;
i &apos;ll figure something out .
but to me , what &apos;s shocking is not just the amount of light , but the fact that it &apos;s not just luci@@ ferin and luci@@ fer@@ ase .
curi@@ ti@@ ba , my city : three million in the metropolitan area , 1,@@ 80@@ 0,000 people in the city itself .
they want to talk to the people who do , and maybe it &apos;ll spread .
that was very interesting .
why do they go to see the mon@@ a lisa ?
the idea of peop@@ le-@@ work is what we work with here , and i have to make a bond with my designers when we &apos;re creating b@@ m@@ ws .
and this is my family .
so , i think that &apos;s good .
and this is the same thing , money down there , and health , you know ?
there is a chemical that &apos;s called per@@ flu@@ br@@ on .
so next , the scientific method -- an axi@@ om of physics , of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation , you can only dis@@ prove it .
it &apos;s simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body .
and i had an ar@@ mor@@ ed organization at that point .
fishermen knew about these things ; they caught them , and they deple@@ ted them .
you lay down a couple of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body , keep the blade sharp , never force it -- and these are things kids can understand and practice with .
it adverti@@ sed -- the way that you might be asked , if you were part of the internet , to de@@ clare what you see near you -- it adverti@@ sed that near it , in fact , it had suddenly awa@@ ken@@ ed to find that it was youtube .
so , looking wide , using your peripher@@ al vision , is a really interesting place to look for opportunity .
one thing we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t think is that compassion makes you miserable .
and then of course , this one , our governor at the moment .
yet , their dra@@ gl@@ ines are not the toughest .
the second thing , in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage , the second thing i learned is this : we have to talk about shame .
unbe@@ know@@ nst to many of you , the highway in the sky that i &apos;m talking about here has been under construction for 10 years .
and essentially , the story is this with right whales , that about a million years ago , there was one species of right whale on the planet , but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated , the species sort of separated , and today we have essentially two distinct stocks .
now the relationship between the state and society in china is very different from that in the west .
now a couple of things that i have in my head about this project are , wouldn &apos;t it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this ?
but this glacier ca@@ ved into the water and a seal got on it .
what then of man@@ ned space exploration ?
this is a robot that can climb structures .
but what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones .
and these a@@ wait our discovery .
so this system that was built for ted is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this , and we &apos;re looking very hard at how to make it highly cost-@@ effective to use in places like africa and other parts of the world .
that &apos;s pretty much what managers are for . they &apos;re for interrup@@ ting people .
this is a graph of photographs tagged iraq as taken by the 5@@ 29 photographers who contributed the 5,@@ 4@@ 45 photos .
so this woman , this boy &apos;s mother installed this latr@@ ine in a few hours .
that clou@@ dy white mass that you see is the recur@@ r@@ ence of the tumor .
it really helps you appreciate the good times .
this is po@@ o , and what i want to do today is share my passion for po@@ o with you , which might be quite difficult , but i think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with po@@ o .
we create financial markets that are super complex .
and the poor man said , &quot; and you mean god didn &apos;t answer my ple@@ as ? &quot;
yes . but we need mechan@@ ization .
the crisis is now inevitable .
and i threw away my ra@@ ke .
and particularly , how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy , create less pollution and are more socially responsible ?
they &apos;ve gotten bigger ; they &apos;re spread out .
it &apos;s obviously a very big commercial company , and so this little , &quot; sh@@ h -- it &apos;s not really them , &quot; was put on the side of the imagery .
the first was quite simple . i finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimi@@ zing my treatment for longevity .
by 18 , under the excellent tu@@ tel@@ age of my mother , i was therefore , as you might expect , defi@@ antly feminist .
i , for one , was ste@@ ep@@ ed in these .
and i was clever@@ ly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill .
charles eames : in india , those without , and the lowest in ca@@ ste , eat very often , particularly in southern india , and those a little bit up the scale eat off of a sort of a low-@@ fired ceram@@ ic dish .
this was for mass communication .
some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family .
and it &apos;s time to begin thinking about it , even if the reason we &apos;re thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn &apos;t do it .
and some 10 years ago , i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
well a good place to start is with waste .
a student , a young woman in a four@@ th-@@ floor hall@@ way of her ly@@ ce@@ e , per@@ ched on the le@@ dge of an open window chat@@ ting with friends between classes ; a teacher passes and chi@@ des her , &quot; be careful , you might fall , &quot; almost ban@@ ter@@ ingly chi@@ des her , &quot; you might fall , &quot; and the young woman , 18 , a girl really , though she wouldn &apos;t think that , as brilliant as she is , first in her class , and &quot; beautiful , too , &quot; she &apos;s often told , smiles back , and leans into the open window , which wouldn &apos;t even be open if it were winter -- if it were winter someone would have closed it -- leans into the window , farther , still smiling , farther and farther , though it takes less time than this , really an instant , and lets herself fall .
most of them have kor@@ sa@@ ko@@ ff &apos;s syndrome , a poly@@ neu@@ ri@@ tic psycho@@ sis that -- they drank way too much , and they can &apos;t make new memories .
and of bro@@ th@@ els where children are forced to receive five , 15 clients per day , and if they rebel , they are tortured with electricity .
they rock the mic outside my window every morning .
and i turn to esther , who &apos;s ro@@ cking on those &apos; ports , and says , &quot; you know what , honey ? &quot;
number one : don &apos;t let go -- very sure success method .
you know , if this is so , it occurred to me that maybe , just maybe , the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity .
exploring at the frontier of science , at the frontier of human understanding , is mind-@@ blowing .
in art school , phil hansen developed an un@@ ru@@ ly tre@@ mor in his hand that kept him from creating the poin@@ ti@@ lli@@ st drawings he loved . hansen was devastated , floating without a sense of purpose . until a neurolog@@ ist made a simple suggestion : embrace this limitation ... and transcend it .
essentially it had done something very simple .
well , it &apos;s not so surprising that they &apos;ve gone extinct .
okay , i think 99@@ .@@ 9 would about cover it .
these comics are a fundamental way that children , especially in the diaspora , learn their religious and myth@@ ological folk tales .
well , law is also a powerful driver of human behavior .
this is a culture that has yiel@@ ded ell@@ s@@ worth wh@@ are@@ ham .
gary lau@@ der &apos;s new traffic sign : take turns
in the ol@@ den days , explorers like vas@@ co da g@@ ama and colum@@ bus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
so a typical cell , like the neurons in our brain , has a region called the den@@ dri@@ tes that recei@@ ves input , and that input sums together and will produce action potenti@@ als that run down the ax@@ on and then activate all the output regions of the neuron .
just over three years ago , i was for the first time in car@@ ac@@ as , venezuela , and while flying over the city , i was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city , a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums , dra@@ ped literally all over the mountains .
yet as much as i love stories , recently , i &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
now , i know that &apos;s a dirty word for some people , but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas , the chimpanzee and also the bonobos .
we &apos;ve got what &apos;s rational for public health .
now , this little anec@@ dote gets to the heart of why i &apos;m really passionate about collaborative consumption , and why , after i finished my book , i decided i &apos;m going to try and spread this into a global movement .
so we are so lucky that we have resources like the internet , where we can circum@@ vent these institutions from the bottom up .
so what happens when you leave your lab and you go outside into the real world ?
those fossil fuels have built our civilization .
places that are not markets , see@@ ding it with the principles of sat@@ u@@ ration , connectivity , low ages , etc .
how about that ? do you think your bank is going to show that to people ?
well , i understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
and this is also due to these fantastic new scan@@ ners , that just in 0.@@ 3 seconds , i can scan the whole heart , and i can do that with time resolution .
anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded , and clearly his behavior is being disrup@@ ted .
and the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit , turning to the mountain , actually , to talk to them directly .
and certainly , this was the decade in which we discovered aids and the virus that causes it , hiv .
where do they get their food ?
what really makes it amazing : that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too .
and i would look at them -- this is not an accident .
every night he was enjoying his work , he was staying late , he was perfe@@ cting this powerpoint presentation .
so it &apos;s going to take brilliant people like you to study these things , get other people involved -- and you &apos;re helping to come up with solutions .
it would really boost the economy .
strategic .
but you &apos;re young , you could still try again . &quot;
and although i think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because i do know something about that -- he wasn &apos;t as empowered , i think , as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive , which i think has its basis in all of us in our play history .
now , if he practices for a year and takes lessons , he &apos;s now eight and he sounds like this .
and to a man who did not understand , i heard someone say , &quot; you know , you &apos;ve been here for a few hours trying to understand , discussing with your fellows .
so , we did another experiment .
the middle two sections make up our lim@@ bic brains , and our lim@@ bic brains are responsible for all of our feelings , like trust and loyalty .
margaret wer@@ thei@@ m leads a project to re-@@ create the creatures of the coral reefs using a croch@@ et technique invented by a mathematician -- celebrating the amaz@@ ements of the reef , and deep-@@ diving into the hyperbolic geometry underlying coral creation .
when we really begin to feel darwin &apos;s insights in our bones , the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hopeful about .
they use a skeleton that we call a hydro@@ static skeleton .
it &apos;s not just ham@@ mers and gadgets , like laptops .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
we want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid kev@@ l@@ ar , to this natural kev@@ l@@ ar .
look at some stone tools .
what will i stand up for ?
red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue . let &apos;s say red wants to keep 70 , and offers blue 30 . so he offers a 7@@ 0-@@ 30 split with blue .
it &apos;s partly due to tax cuts that were un@@ funded , but it &apos;s due primarily to the rise of enti@@ t@@ lement spending , especially medi@@ care .
why ? because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job .
everything in the kitchen was sal@@ va@@ ged .
and nature really does ab@@ h@@ or a vacuum .
so when i open the bottle , the alcohol molecules would spread in the air , and that &apos;s because alcohol is a very vola@@ tile substance .
maybe that &apos;s the solution , maybe we should send kids to school .
and let me go back to that image of the mediterranean .
a couple of different reasons come to mind .
this is frightening .
so , more interestingly , i &apos;m interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way .
now there &apos;s a reason why i study this , versus traditional anthropolog@@ y .
and the test is : one , will it do the job ?
ro@@ l@@ f bo@@ lin , who was a professor at the hop@@ kin &apos;s marine station where i work , wrote in the 194@@ 0s that &quot; the f@@ umes from the sc@@ um floating on the in@@ lets of the bay were so bad they turned le@@ ad@@ -based pain@@ ts black . &quot;
but i want everybody to raise their hand at some point .
because it &apos;s so hard to admit our own fal@@ li@@ bility .
this is a clear don norman watch .
so , whatever you think of crea@@ tion@@ ism -- and i think it &apos;s crazy -- they did a great job .
russia . chad wanted to fight against hom@@ opho@@ bia in russia .
bf : yeah , it &apos;s too far . it &apos;s too much of a visual .
it &apos;s called a@@ pro@@ pos of the italian ada@@ ge that i lifted from his forward , &quot; if this be treas@@ on . &quot;
that &apos;s something different from the system that is the pleasure system , which simply says , &quot; i like this . &quot;
how many times have you been told that real , substantial change isn &apos;t possible because most people are too selfish , too stupid or too la@@ zy to try to make a difference in their community ?
so get out your pen and paper .
now , let me hit a som@@ ber note .
get out of the airplane , it turns out you &apos;re tre@@ k@@ king in nepal .
if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money wh@@ il@@ st creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet , isn &apos;t that a wonderful opportunity ? isn &apos;t that the way to go ?
and also quantitative data , so what was the average length of their profile , how much time was spent between messages ?
but it will also lay waste to imagination .
and what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the u.s. military , and he says , &quot; you know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
and yet , we all rejected this project , none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it , and it was the first project to be implemented .
you know it , i know it , but let &apos;s not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we &apos;ll spend all day here .
and if we take the long-term trends of life , if we begin to say , what does evolution want ? there &apos;s several things that we see .
but they &apos;re very small , you know ?
they give you the strange t-shirt , take you to the nearest mental institution .
stop . do you see the pattern ?
because , when people heard that my son was a victim , i got immediate sympathy .
here we go .
but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar .
i use the word &quot; want . &quot; technology wants .
what &apos;s happening is the internet is re@@ moving the midd@@ le@@ man , so that anyone from a t-shirt designer to a kni@@ tter can make a living selling peer-to-peer .
so in mor@@ oc@@ co , for example , they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats .
and it &apos;s actually a way of playing the game , of playing all the games .
indeed .
so if it is those networks and their mathematical structure , unlike biology , which had sub@@ linear scaling , economies of scale , you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger .
but my argument is that , if you want to understand the global village , it &apos;s probably a good idea that you figure out what they &apos;re passionate about , what am@@ uses them , what they choose to do in their free time .
you can draw from this .
always i &apos;ve found two , but the wrong color . spades , sorry .
now june the ninth , 2009 , we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine , and it turned out to be a gam@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger .
and it &apos;s one of the most awful things -- heart@@ warming , but awful .
we can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like 28 times the land utili@@ zation with that kind of strategy .
well , we got the answer on the 28@@ th february &apos; 53 .
so when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in china explaining the project .
you &apos;ll see that start right here .
and the wat@@ ch@@ maker turned around and said , &quot; god can see it . &quot;
ab@@ ha da@@ wes@@ ar : life in the &quot; digital now &quot;
sue wasn &apos;t trying to achieve difference in her life .
these are three gra@@ pes ; the monkey &apos;s really psych@@ ed for this .
it &apos;s the beginning .
to build that , what we &apos;d do with whirlwind technology is we &apos;d have to take up roughly from the 10 to mul@@ holland , and from the 40@@ 5 to la ci@@ en@@ eg@@ a just with those whirl@@ winds .
we included in this information some references to some funny , absolutely legal , but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online .
even if you don &apos;t like it , you &apos;ll have to get used to this because at the moment , 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock .
it &apos;s a magical re@@ alist novel .
i mean , that &apos;s , at least , how it made me happy .
and in particular , every single one of the major world traditions has high@@ ligh@@ ted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition what &apos;s become known as the golden rule .
and this is a guy from salt lake city , this is what they look like out there .
and then we did a series of calculations , and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring .
but it has the ability to over@@ ride our feelings .
i &apos;ll give you a demonstration of how it works .
but k@@ und , which uses the gyp@@ sum belt , for that you have to go back to your calendar , three million years ago .
so is one of the parties lying , or is there some other alternative explanation ?
my cat gave birth to four kit@@ tens , pur@@ ring all the time .
they &apos;re killing each other .
it &apos;s not to do with electricity or water .
so , how do you go about studying the brain ?
when medicine became somewhat scientific , in about 450 bc , with hippo@@ cr@@ ates and those boys , they tried to look for her@@ bs , plants that would literally shake the bad spirits out .
the societal cost of this condition is huge .
we have to figure out how to make this tra@@ de@@ off between growing food and having a healthy environment work better .
bill gates : well bruce , where do you think the toughest places are going to be ?
i mean , think about how different cities are , actually .
we have the tools . we have the kno@@ who@@ w , and we can take the lessons we &apos;ve learned from the fight against global jihad , the victory against global jihad , and apply those to local jihad .
in that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear .
we &apos;ll reduce not only calories , but our carbon footprint .
i feel it &apos;s sort of like the vi@@ mal@@ ak@@ ir@@ ti su@@ tra , an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area , va@@ is@@ hal@@ i , and they bring some sort of jewel@@ ed paras@@ ols to make an offering to him .
you can sc@@ arc@@ ely imagine the kind of ha@@ vo@@ c you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a gps spoofer .
we love new stuff -- new material stuff for sure -- but also new ideas , new adventures , new experiences .
i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of story@@ tell@@ ers , and i think that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this .
hmm . not .
a child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
and it was reflected in our architecture , it was reflected in the way that we taught students , and this mainframe ment@@ ality persi@@ sts today .
some of you are in the field , i can see .
so if human need is the place to start , and prototyping , a vehicle for progress , then there are also some questions to ask about the destination .
he did this because he understands data as well as books .
they survive because medieval scri@@ bes copied them and copied them and copied them .
and i want to score a point here , because my husband is in the room over there .
so i want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by frank s@@ hen and professor nathan michael that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time and creating this map on the fly .
he learned , from watching this kid who he eventually hired , who was really successful for him , that it wasn &apos;t sw@@ inging for the f@@ ences , it wasn &apos;t sw@@ inging at every pitch like the slu@@ g@@ gers do , which is what all the expensive teams like the yan@@ ke@@ es like to -- they like to pick up those guys .
how do we explain that diversity ?
it &apos;s called the comfort .
we fast-@@ track . we figure out the game .
other people say no , that &apos;s not enough , there have to be basic liberal rights : free speech , free press , equality of citizens .
we touch every nation . every nation touches us .
so the 99 attributes of alla@@ h have the yin and the yang ; there &apos;s the powerful , the he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ous , the strong , and there &apos;s also the kind , the generous .
smile , friendly .
but , every so often , we come across children who show some resi@@ du@@ al vision , and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treat@@ able .
this lever@@ ages millions of years of evolution by re@@ designing bugs to make really useful products .
so a few years after this event , i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swar@@ th@@ more college for my education .
they were allowed to return to jerusalem and to rebuild the temple .
it &apos;s a finite resource ; it &apos;s always dra@@ ining away .
on the night of june 11th , 2003 , he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the manhattan bridge and he leap@@ ed to the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous waters below .
i got my masters , and then went to art school after that .
susan cain : the power of introver@@ ts
this is the way we treat people as responsible adults .
passenger aircraft crash , one in 20,000 .
these heroic acts are present all over the country .
and i hold in my hand a tissu@@ e-@@ mimi@@ cking phantom .
biology -- we have co-@@ adapted through biology to like bright colors .
so this is what we started with 15 years ago , with the cosmic background explorer -- made the map on the upper right , which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations , and actually fluctuations on several scales . you can kind of see that .
they have invented dr@@ ones to transport drugs , cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ts , you name it .
it stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet .
this does not have to happen .
the other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important , and so naturally , people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities .
most western intellec@@ tu@@ als look at this situation and say , &quot; well , there &apos;s nothing for the dalai lama to be really right about -- really right about -- or for ted bund@@ y to be really wrong about that admit@@ s of a real argument that potentially falls within the pur@@ view of science .
i was also fortunate enough to be cher@@ ished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well , including my father , my brother , un@@ cles and grand@@ fathers .
so on the one hand , this is just a basic reco@@ ding of the electronic medical record .
when we talk about corruption , there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind .
these gorillas were murdered , some would even say cru@@ ci@@ fied , and uns@@ ur@@ pris@@ ingly , they spar@@ ked international ou@@ trage .
is new york a scaled up san francisco , which is a scaled up santa fe ?
and that is what the usda allows in our food supply .
and today , we &apos;re producing it from your old stuff , and it &apos;s going right back into your new stuff .
paul root wol@@ pe : it &apos;s time to question bio-@@ engineering
that &apos;s crazy . it was never designed to do things like that .
now , for those of you who don &apos;t know , a ru@@ be gold@@ berg machine is a complicated contra@@ ption , an incredibly over-@@ engineered piece of machinery that accompli@@ shes a relatively simple task .
ss : aimee and i thought we &apos;d just talk a little bit , and i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete .
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men i would ever meet .
there we go .
i &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of -- you know , kind of lost a little .
and he said that was impossible .
so of course , what you don &apos;t do properly yourself is never de@@ em@@ ed done really .
so what i &apos;m going to talk about is why we don &apos;t have a good brain theory , why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it .
and unfortunately , i can be a little too honest .
printing press took a century to be adopted ; the first computers were designed pen@@ -@@ on-@@ paper -- now we use computers .
so we should recognize that inter@@ dependence , by formal , mutual commit@@ ments .
milo : okay .
here &apos;s the six . we went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he &apos;d do a million .
walls don &apos;t work .
one such project is about a year and a half old .
new organi@@ zational models coming about , mixing closed and open in tricky ways .
i ask you , who jo@@ ins the military to do things other than war ?
because when we buy a car we go to the de@@ aler once , we have an interaction , and we &apos;re cho@@ w -- usually as quickly as possible .
i had absolutely no idea what i was about to become part of , and i was incredibly lucky .
she had a bleeding up in the brain , and that &apos;s been fixed with a little stent , a metal cl@@ amp that &apos;s ti@@ ghten@@ ing up the vessel .
because we are confronted with a challenge .
sorry , two of diamonds . i &apos;ll do it quick now .
lots of you can afford to buy one of these .
so , i say , &apos; per@@ don , yo no hab@@ lo ing@@ les . &apos; well , wouldn &apos;t you know , he had been in hon@@ dur@@ as for the peace corps . &quot;
and it had to recognize their different habits , different peoples , different religions , different fai@@ ths .
and there &apos;s a wonderful man sitting in this audience , and i don &apos;t know where he is , who said to me a few days ago -- because i did a little rehear@@ sal -- and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares , and one of them is white . &quot;
tribes lost millions of acres .
and he didn &apos;t buy a sculpture , so i made one .
it requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension , but in two dimensions i think you can see the beautiful symmetry and illum@@ ination of a normal mind at work .
these are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; practical jo@@ king with pir@@ ates . &quot;
push this idea a little bit forward .
we had this miracle on the hudson in new york city , you know , in january , and suddenly sul@@ ly has become a key name on baby@@ center .
what sticks with people ?
i think i have it .
just now i was functioning in the role of the interpre@@ ter , and there i am , interpre@@ ter .
now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism ; they &apos;re doing it because they &apos;re learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest .
and as a chemist , we &apos;re not used to profound questions every day .
and it was really moving . and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away , where the contents of the capsule were being be@@ amed into space .
has anyone here ever been to school ?
i talked about that earlier .
mostly they &apos;re worried about each other .
lane three is 12@@ .@@ 5 . lane four is 12@@ .@@ 2 . i said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
here &apos;s why .
and , just to kind of tear down a myth here , lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus , it &apos;s because you went to a porn site .
i was going to work with small farmers .
so , maybe what is happening is that there &apos;s a level of cheating we can &apos;t go over , but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree , as long as it doesn &apos;t change our impres@@ sions about ourselves .
humans in the developed world spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors , where they breathe in and come into contact with trilli@@ ons of life forms invisible to the naked eye : micro@@ organisms .
that &apos;s what they thought they had built it for .
that profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they &apos;re trying to solve .
and then they re@@ package them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile sy@@ ringe in the first place , which is quite bizarre .
already in about 20 states private inst@@ all@@ ers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill .
how do you reconcile the two things ?
but she still lives in math@@ are valley .
third thing on my checklist : relations with friend@@ lies that can sustain the society . in montana today , more than half of the income of montana is not earned within montana , but is derived from out of state : transfer payments from social security , investments and so on -- which makes montana vulnerable to the rest of the united states .
now there are three levels of self to consider -- the pro@@ to , the core and the auto@@ biogra@@ phi@@ cal .
that won &apos;t do much difference .
and here you can see an engineer -- it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer -- create a product in 3d .
so i had 50 overall summar@@ ies done .
and those are the pe@@ at sw@@ amp forests on 20 meters of pe@@ at , the largest accumu@@ lation of organic material in the world .
and before the year 2000 -- now remember , triceratops was first found in the 18@@ 00s -- before 2000 , no one had ever seen a juvenile triceratops .
here is our founding meeting .
now i &apos;m sure as everyone in the audience already knows -- i did have to explain it to my nine-@@ year-old late last week -- pen@@ ises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another .
the schizophren@@ ic mind is not split , but shat@@ tered .
so why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind ?
our asthma hospit@@ alization rate is seven times higher than the national average .
stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
one takes down networks , one puts them up .
sm : so you know what &apos;s happened ?
we just did some pa@@ sting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks .
namely , essentially an elimin@@ ation of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed , to get sick in the first place .
does texting mean the death of good writing skills ? john mc@@ wh@@ or@@ ter pos@@ its that there &apos;s much more to texting -- lingui@@ stically , culturally -- than it seems , and it &apos;s all good news .
now i &apos;m a middle-@@ aged guy .
although we don &apos;t have statistics for warfare throughout the middle ages to modern times , we know just from conventional history -- the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanc@@ tioned forms of violence .
and vital@@ -@@ signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death .
he said the sick country means syria , iran , china and north korea .
and yet it &apos;s a skill that none of us are taught .
but what is really amazing , because of this deep@@ ness here , emper@@ or penguins can go down more than 500 meters and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes .
i &apos;m 80 miles from shore , what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
wait for it .
cr@@ yo@@ preservation pioneer of great depth is oliver r@@ y@@ der .
but if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever .
and thirdly , the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a c@@ liche . and i &apos;m happy to say , i was partly responsible for that c@@ liche that machines are becoming biological , but that &apos;s pretty evident .
fascinating work they &apos;re doing .
&quot; even in purely non-@@ religious terms , homosexu@@ ality represents a mis@@ use of the sexual fac@@ ulty .
it &apos;s actually managed by the network .
and then of course , there was the other ada@@ ge .
and now i &apos;m ti@@ ghten@@ ing las@@ hes , shaped in hide as if around a ri@@ b@@ cage , shaped like five bow@@ strings .
the problem i see is that , ultimately , the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home , and climate change , are a head-@@ on collision about to happen , or already happening .
this , no doubt , is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities .
but the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child .
i guess what i want to say to everybody here -- and i know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans , but this is a problem that we &apos;ve created as consumers and we can solve .
thank you .
what was that story ? the death of anna nicole smith .
i go , &quot; great . &quot; and so they drive me down , they get me out on the tar@@ mac , and there was this red , white and blue airplane .
and instead of telling you , i &apos;ll just show you .
imagine way back , four and a half billion years ago , there is a vast chemical soup of stuff .
i suggested we should have occupy death .
i really believe that you have to have a passion for it .
it was a great place to grow up , but it &apos;s one of the most vulnerable spots in the world .
because he was afraid i was walking into a trap .
and it turns out that , in fact , technologies don &apos;t die .
and it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would top@@ ple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that fat@@ alism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
and i realized just what had happened to me at swar@@ th@@ more , this transformation -- the ability to confront problems , complex problems , and to design solutions to those problems .
he hung up on me !
why ? because it &apos;s ti@@ ring and we feel fa@@ ti@@ gue .
in fact , if we look at the genetic code , it &apos;s the only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things to avoid malari@@ al deaths .
how to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities ? do we want them to be the same ?
so if you put it in the front door , your design fails .
it &apos;s like when i am trying to stand on one foot .
girl : 5@@ 81 . this house is 5@@ 81 ...
perhaps that was the intention .
and it was like that for me . i love that movie .
and it was introduced only for the u.s. dollars .
he just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-@@ air .
and they said , &quot; yeah , yeah , we &apos;ll walk . we &apos;ll find some camels . &quot;
obesity costs you americans 10 percent of your healthcare bills , 150 billion dollars a year .
all along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long , slow climate change , and that really changed in 1980 , in this rocky out@@ crop near gu@@ b@@ bio , where walter al@@ v@@ arez , trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks , which held creatures of the cre@@ tac@@ e@@ ous period , and the pink rocks above , which held ter@@ ti@@ ary fossils .
and so they ple@@ aded with me to get a degree in something .
all of system d really doesn &apos;t pay taxes , right ?
for those of you who don &apos;t know it , it was illegal to eat ice cream under the taliban .
all of these speakers , by the way , are young women , 18 or 19 years old .
so this is an example from the yahoo regi@@ stration page .
they made it aspi@@ rational .
the colors are codes for the direction , from whether it is back to front or vice versa .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat ve@@ g and olive oil have fewer skin wrin@@ kles .
so , doctors prescribe medication .
under the delu@@ ge of minu@@ te-@@ to-@@ minute text conversations , emails , rel@@ ent@@ less exchange of media channels and pass@@ words and apps and remin@@ ders and tweets and tags , we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place : ourselves .
my colleagues had thou@@ ght@@ fully put on the wheel where i was supposed to work a very nicely mod@@ eled natural man &apos;s organs .
they weren &apos;t su@@ ed because there was carcin@@ o@@ gens in the chicken , but they were su@@ ed because of california &apos;s proposition 65 , which stated that if there &apos;s anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning .
bring infrastructure to the favelas , to the slums , wherever you are .
think of it in terms of dru@@ ms of water , each containing 200 li@@ ters .
but when i looked down , i realized that time mar@@ ched on for me too and that i needed to get caught up , so i got going on it .
what all these people have in common is that they are her@@ e@@ tics .
and so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed , and he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;m sleeping a lot . &quot;
and when you see the two giant cats here , pushing forward , you see that in between them and ahead of them , is the whole emerging economies of the world , which thomas friedman so correctly called the &quot; flat world . &quot;
you tell them .
and of course , as the computer industry develops inter@@ actively , producers in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea .
we could actually go to may@@ flower to eisenhower , and that would be put together into a developing world , which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way , which have great entrepreneurs , but also have the collap@@ sing countries .
the internet was that am@@ orph@@ ous blob , or it was a silly black box with a blin@@ king red light on it .
you have your interpretation . we have ours .
the indian cle@@ vern@@ ess was using its traditional knowledge , however , scientifically vali@@ dating it and making that journey from men to mice to men , not molecule to mice to men , you know .
he fl@@ ed germany , together with his family , leaving everything else behind .
and there are a series of behaviors that we &apos;ve lear@@ nt as kids , and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers .
we need to move one step beyond that now .
this has really invi@@ gor@@ ated me day-to-day , when i wake up , to try and do something interesting with my day .
and this was two weeks ago .
when i began recording over four decades ago , i could record for 10 hours good enough for an album or a film soundtrack or a museum installation .
two things we &apos;re going to start with -- the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that upli@@ ft me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
it &apos;s the result of very sustained and pro@@ lon@@ ged political ac@@ tivism that you get the right regulations , and that you get the right corporate behavior .
so in this example , a distribution company has said , we &apos;ve got a rush order that we &apos;ve got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning .
the idea was , &quot; vote your conscience , &quot; vote for mister splashy pants .
the old festivals , they continued to thrive , but from bri@@ gh@@ ton to rio to per@@ th , something new was emerging , and these festivals were really different .
in this funny and bl@@ unt talk , larry smith pulls no pun@@ ches when he calls out the absurd excuses people invent when they fail to pursue their passions . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and i went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually -- you can barely see it , and the reason for that is it &apos;s entirely dark in there -- this is a ca@@ ver@@ n that was left behind by the min@@ ers who left this mine in 1960 .
you probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on fuel and photo@@ copying and per di@@ em , and then for some reason , momentum is lost or there &apos;s no money left , and all of that comes to nothing because no one actually types it into the computer at all .
we asked this question 10 years ago .
so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods , things from which all of us can benefit ?
i started my own experiments .
i have to go to school , get a job , send my kids to lessons ... &quot; you think , &quot; i &apos;m too busy . i don &apos;t have time for art . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go to hip replacement .
they &apos;re actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other .
so we looked at the mo@@ dem , an important part of the infrastructure of the internet , and asked ourselves why the mode@@ ms that we are using right now are built for a different context , where you &apos;ve got ubiquitous internet , you &apos;ve got ubiquitous electricity , yet we sit here in nairobi and we do not have that luxury .
i want to find out what &apos;s in this zone .
here &apos;s how the game is played : there are two players ; they &apos;ve never played the game before , they will not play the game again , they don &apos;t know each other , and they are , in fact , in separate rooms .
at present , that &apos;s not happening in new york city .
it was an exhilar@@ ating fight , and i &apos;d repeat the fight today without a moment &apos;s hes@@ itation .
boys &apos; brains are being digitally re@@ wired in a totally new way for change , novelty , excitement and constant arou@@ sal .
but design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health .
person@@ i@@ fication and the im@@ pu@@ ting of intentional purpose is such a brilli@@ antly successful way to model humans , it &apos;s hardly surprising the same modeling software often sei@@ zes control when we &apos;re trying to think about entities for which it &apos;s not appropriate , like bas@@ il fa@@ w@@ l@@ ty with his car or like millions of delu@@ ded people with the universe as a whole .
you see , i have a passion for racing .
but i &apos;m killing them .
some 7@@ 0-@@ year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back gol@@ fing , or gar@@ dening .
it becomes kit@@ e-@@ shaped .
and he &apos;d tell you , &quot; well most people say thri@@ ved , but some people say thro@@ ve . &quot;
anes@@ thes@@ i@@ ologists , surgeons are waiting around .
it &apos;s like having your car stolen . it &apos;s an inferior option .
me being me , i put the numbers from my hospital &apos;s website from my tumor sizes into a spre@@ ad@@ sheet .
it took us 33 days , 23 hours and 55 minutes to get there .
but if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane , i think you need to learn to live , not without regret , but with it .
so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemi@@ cs and so forth , let &apos;s start with that . and since i got that idea , i &apos;ve had to shake hundreds of hands .
this was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual , and having me be the brush in their self-@@ portrait .
so for a few hours , it all passed through china .
you know , this is crazy . we do this all the time , even on an everyday level .
in fact , it was so successful that there &apos;s no way that these days you could make a book like this .
so , how does one do that ?
it &apos;s not that experts have not massively contributed to the world -- of course they have .
i mean , from 1965 to 1973 there were more muni@@ tions that fell on cambodia than in all of world war ii japan , including the two nuclear bombs of august 1945 .
and i hope to god the united states government , me , or ted , or somebody helps us do that , because that would be an incredible thing for their country .
and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you &apos;re holding in your hand -- and you know , we shared the same ideas . and you could see it in his face : roman starts to get really excited and he whi@@ ps out this man@@ ila fol@@ der ; he opens it up and keith and i look in , and he starts showing us concepts that he &apos;s been working on .
people , please . we can &apos;t wh@@ ine and complain the west is doing this .
so , imagine a lens the size of a football field .
across europe , a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to commun@@ ity-@@ based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential . when i first started to work in roman@@ ia nearly 20 years ago , there were 200,000 children living in institutions , and more entering every day .
now , the first question was answered in 19@@ 26 by a fellow named o@@ sk@@ ar klein .
you have a huge ring .
but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart , a giraffe , a star ?
is nothing sacred anymore , for heaven &apos;s sake ?
then you look at the phenomenon of kog@@ i .
and consider treating psychotic disorders -- and i want this involved with the ted group -- such as obsessi@@ ve-@@ comp@@ ul@@ sive disorder that , pres@@ ently , is not well treated with drugs , and includes five million americans .
designer ross lo@@ ve@@ grove ex@@ pounds his philosophy of &quot; fat@@ -free &quot; design and offers insight into several of his extraordinary products , including the ty nant water bottle and the go chair .
and they funded two weeks of shooting in new york .
our printing press is the internet . our coffee houses are social networks .
fab@@ ian he@@ mmert demos one future of the mobile phone -- a sha@@ pe-@@ shifting and wei@@ ght-@@ shifting hand@@ set that &quot; displays &quot; information non@@ visually , offering a deli@@ ght@@ fully intuitive way to communicate . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but what sergio was talking about is , let &apos;s cali@@ bra@@ te our relationship to the threat .
in some places , that &apos;s part of it .
and the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis . right ?
and before the kind of collapse of the communist system , i was privileged to meet a lot of cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts in space city and other places in russia .
i was walking onto a plane -- this , for me , was a pi@@ vot@@ al moment in my career , and it really c@@ em@@ ented what i wanted to do with this whole pu@@ pp@@ y-@@ training thing , the notion of how to teach pu@@ pp@@ ies in a do@@ g-@@ friendly way to want to do what we want to do , so we don &apos;t have to force them .
this is this year in austri@@ a .
i &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aware of , and that &apos;s the example of al-qaeda .
it was very hard at first .
you &apos;re seeing for the first time , a brand new dry@@ wall production line , not made using gyp@@ sum at all .
what &apos;s interesting is , in fact , the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine , the breast cancer promot@@ er , now sells us the blo@@ cker -- the exact same company .
that night , there was a stick in the hut .
david lang is a maker who taught himself to become an amateur ocean@@ ograph@@ er -- or , he taught a robot to be one for him . in a charming talk lang , a fellow , shows how he and a network of ocean lo@@ vers te@@ amed up to build open-@@ sourced , low-cost underwater explorers .
wk : in mal@@ awi , kas@@ ung@@ u . in kas@@ ung@@ u . yeah , mal@@ a .
&quot; that &apos;s what i thought , &quot; she said .
so take a look around this auditorium today .
do they allow for pollin@@ ation , pollin@@ ator pathways that bees and butter@@ flies and such can come back into our cities ?
pun@@ e has 5,000 building sites .
and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked , &quot; okay , are there differences in the type of foxo genes among people who live a really long time ? &quot; and there are .
what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone , so when they were in dil@@ ute suspen@@ sion , they made no light .
we have this molecule , but it &apos;s not a pill yet .
now , this is an area -- i mean , there is a treasure tro@@ ve of wealth in the traditional medicine area .
but only in the last 120 years people started , or people knew more and more how to exploit , or how to use , this biological control phenomenon , or in fact , natural control phenomenon , to their own needs .
couldn &apos;t actually turn back very much , because if you were king a thousand years ago , while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to tra@@ verse your own country , there wasn &apos;t much you were in charge of .
cock@@ tails , more poly@@ valent vaccines .
it &apos;s very much about the way we link thinking and doing .
this is an early design for this little three-@@ wheel , it &apos;s an electronic bike . you have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane , but if you &apos;re an older person , that &apos;s a switch . if you &apos;re a healthy person , you might have to work really hard to go fast .
should it be by just walking around looking down ?
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
so here &apos;s one last thing i &apos;d like to mention .
now , i do this stuff because it &apos;s fun .
a pretty idy@@ lli@@ c place on the me@@ kong delta .
a pe@@ as@@ ant , who was walking to market that morning , ran towards where the g@@ uns@@ hot had come from , and found a young man wri@@ thing in ag@@ ony on the floor , clearly shot by a du@@ eling wound .
in germany , we are pushing the rati@@ fication of the un convention , which is a subsequ@@ ent convention .
she said , &quot; come to my apartment . &quot;
well , it &apos;s a rather complex system , but let me try to explain it , maybe simpli@@ fy it .
and just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family , we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people .
so that &apos;s why it looks maybe a little bit weird , especially to the people who deal with structures in general .
so , from that mythology , the upper city and lower city come .
you &apos;re allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being .
but let &apos;s use it consciously . like why have games that you can lose ?
each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test .
a recent study from bri@@ g@@ ham young university school of family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real-@@ life relationships with them .
what i &apos;ve found , across the board , is that religion is about be@@ having differently .
they took a dna origami , organized some carbon nano-@@ tubes , made a little switch , you see here , wired it up , tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch .
i watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day , every day , for 18 months .
last year , we ran a &quot; give one , get one &quot; program , and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free .
by the time we jumped into that hall , she was barely moving .
so the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
you hear the rever@@ ber@@ ation as the sound travels over long-@@ range in the ocean and is not quite as loud .
heroin , cocaine , women being traffi@@ cked into prostitution and precious minerals .
well that &apos;s why we have lights above and below the baby in fire@@ fly .
if this is true , if these babies are designed to learn -- and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for -- we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
and as a consequence of this dis@@ agreement , it &apos;s very , very difficult for anyone to say , &quot; i have the right version of islam . &quot;
when our supermarkets have only two or three days &apos; worth of food in them at any one time , often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the free@@ zers and on the packaging that the let@@ tu@@ ces are wrapped up in .
if you could help me with that it would be fantastic .
so their super@@ sti@@ tions , their patter@@ ni@@ cities , are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth .
interviewer : and not for@@ wards and backwards ? boy : no .
as we speak right now , women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we &apos;ve started in our community .
and as it moves around , the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is , so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment .
so because of having cooked food , it &apos;s easier to digest .
so i can drive him around , and i can take pictures of you .
on average , there &apos;s one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the united states .
the second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter in what we call &quot; the natur@@ alist &apos;s trance , &quot; the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting , any quar@@ ry worth taking .
so we had a big problem : we didn &apos;t know how we were going to do this .
and i can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
this is a real difference .
all properties of things are about these kinds of relationships .
but when you &apos;re blind , you have the tac@@ tile memory for things .
i said that was stupid , you know , maybe we should just train them to do something useful .
they had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a aa@@ a , though in many cases , they had virtually bri@@ bed the rating agencies .
and i was working with this young pianist and i said , &quot; the trouble with you is you &apos;re a two-@@ but@@ to@@ ck player .
they started very well . they used the aid well .
you see it in the middle east : people who , from gaza , are firing missi@@ les at israel .
do we get to create organic robots , where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our play@@ things ?
some of it , obviously , is genetic .
in the mor@@ nings it is terrible , and the afternoon is worst .
now i &apos;ll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago .
he &apos;s carrying a cell phone because most in@@ coming calls are free , and that &apos;s how he gets orders from the neighborhood , to know where to collect clothes to get them ir@@ oned .
i mean , we are .
matt mills : image recognition that trig@@ gers augmented reality
and i think , with a death , you have a funeral , you celebrate the life , and there &apos;s a lot of community support , and it &apos;s something women don &apos;t have with mis@@ carriage .
unlike , for example israel , where audiences c@@ ough all the time .
so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask , because i don &apos;t actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports .
he didn &apos;t read a note , and he was profoundly hearing impaired .
and that chain link is really expensive .
my dung is burned as fuel . my milk is used for cheese .
so he &apos;s developing strategies so the vehicle can communicate with pedestri@@ ans , so -- so the head@@ lights are eye@@ balls , the pup@@ ils can di@@ late , we have direc@@ tional audio , we can throw sound directly at people .
and i wouldn &apos;t like anything that is said today to suggest that i am dimin@@ ishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country .
one of the things that i &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to teach you college-@@ level physics .
you could have said , looked the kid in the face , and said , &quot; go for it , kid , just like i did . &quot;
and so we are going to use molecules and re@@ fashion this thing , rebuild everything from the bottom up , using dna in ways that nature never intended , using dna origami , and dna origami to seed this algorith@@ mic self-assembly .
you could have friendship relationships , si@@ bling relationships , spo@@ us@@ al relationships , co-@@ worker relationships , neighbor relationships and the like .
british mp rory stewart walked across afghanistan after 9 / 11 , talking with citizens and war@@ lor@@ ds alike . now , a decade later , he asks : why are western and co@@ alition forces still fighting there ? he shares lessons from past military interventions that worked -- bosnia , for instance -- and shows that humility and local expertise are the keys to success .
they are in front of you .
&quot; yes , i suffered . &quot;
they also found an endangered species sold as a common one .
ba@@ hi@@ a she@@ hab : a thousand times no
this is in 1960 .
now in the early &apos; 70s , one of the great programs in india was to revi@@ tali@@ ze primary science in village schools .
one of the great things was that my father was an a@@ vid gol@@ fer , but he was le@@ fty .
so , one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archae@@ ological sites .
she was ma@@ turing quickly , physically , but her bed was still covered with stu@@ ffed animals .
we had a big show in pra@@ gue , and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat .
so we &apos;re thrilled .
that &apos;s 300 million years per minute .
dopamine &apos;s associated with romantic love , and you can just fall in love with somebody who you &apos;re just having casual sex with .
more than 90 percent , 99 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean .
and from that mu@@ cus , we can get gene profiles , we can get information on gender , checking the pop-@@ up tag one more time , and then it &apos;s out in the ocean .
we &apos;d like to know these things .
this is the first one . this is an electro@@ car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m .
thank you .
it all began with a fantastic phone call .
for instance , that &apos;s why i believe in protecting the environment .
in 1975 , i met in flor@@ ence a professor , car@@ lo pe@@ dre@@ tti , my former professor of art history , and today a world-@@ ren@@ owned scholar of leonardo da vinci .
and the table form is important , and since it &apos;s tou@@ ch-@@ interactive , just like the way they do dis@@ sections in the lab , or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table .
machines are becoming deva@@ stat@@ ingly capable of things like killing . right ?
so , there is a lot of water below the surface .
you &apos;d better leave now if you don &apos;t want to know some of these tricks .
and it can only use so much memory . &quot;
good kanzi . very good . thank you so much .
then we went to work with the manufacturers of aids medicines , one of whom was c@@ ited in the film , and negoti@@ ated a whole different change in business strategy , because even at 500 dollars , these drugs were being sold on a high-@@ margin , low-@@ volume , un@@ certain@@ -@@ payment basis .
there &apos;s no chance of saving him , and just try to save yourself at this point . &quot;
and i use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it .
or better , how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to de@@ fy all of the assumptions ?
john mentioned that i &apos;ve done some work with mur@@ der@@ ers , and i have .
so , on august 15th , independence day , 2007 , the children of riverside set out to infect ah@@ me@@ dab@@ ad .
some of it even came from li@@ anas , those things that dan@@ gle in the middle of the jungle .
so it &apos;s almost exactly -- it &apos;s 50 years ago next tuesday , i guess .
i think we have their attention .
they &apos;re not going to clo@@ g up earth &apos;s ecosystems . they work great .
kt : ok , ok , ok . oh , my god !
and i was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains .
your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one , and the absence of current to represent a zero .
now the big brain did this also with cooking .
you know , there are a bunch of them , including lee &apos;s china in o@@ ma@@ ha -- which is actually run by kore@@ ans , but that &apos;s another point -- and a bunch of them named china buffet .
people are staying away from elite art and criticism .
my history wasn &apos;t right .
and so we didn &apos;t build any models , and francis sort of continued to work on proteins .
the only lighting in that area had to come from artificial sources , and that &apos;s where i go out and i do the actual re@@ construction of the scene with phot@@ ome@@ ters , with various measures of illum@@ ination and various other measures of color perception , along with special cameras and high-speed film , right ?
because they weren &apos;t with us on the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd , an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them .
with over 300 ent@@ ries from around the world , i got it , my own little je@@ wel box .
and it &apos;s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .
sj : and i &apos;ll just be quiet .
anecdot@@ ally , we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor , well bin laden is from one of the richest families in saudi arabia .
if this was the case , we &apos;d have a really easy solution to the problem of human error .
rockett : it &apos;s like i &apos;m just waking up , you know ?
big support team . we had a film crew , a couple of logi@@ stics people with us , my girlfriend , a photographer .
as the juven@@ iles are growing up , their hor@@ ns actually curve backwards .
time for a quick show of hands .
it &apos;s not just what you exclu@@ de from your diet , but also what you include that &apos;s protective .
terrorists , they &apos;re rational .
having more than all the oran@@ gut@@ ans in all the zo@@ os in the world together , just now like victims for every baby , six have disappeared from the forest .
and david and i discovered that we had a question in common , that we really wanted the answer to , and that was , &quot; why hasn &apos;t anybody built any computer games for little girls ? &quot;
and those natural people should let their ideas fly .
par@@ agra@@ ph number two : you may actually have to just get very bl@@ unt and say what &apos;s really on your mind .
when i was in college , i decided to study engineering , like him .
and it went like this : wake up well re@@ sted after a good night &apos;s sleep .
she said , &quot; why don &apos;t you adv@@ ise the koso@@ v@@ ars ?
you know , there is a fear of dying , and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid .
they put their lives on the line , for us , for you , and we cannot let them down .
one of the things that happened very distin@@ ctly in the course of this exhibition is i was confronted with idea of how powerful images can be and people &apos;s understanding of themselves and each other .
and so we lo@@ oped the scenes .
how do you do it from the power of the consumer up ?
but we still have more work to do .
so , i thought okay , now , what is it going to take to make this work ?
and in principle , that &apos;s a very good thing .
and if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digi@@ tized accurately .
another is to change our lifest@@ y@@ les .
if you look at my driver &apos;s license i have the same look , and it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- a pretty disturbing thing but it &apos;s something that is really important .
and that oil was used especially for lighting , but also for d@@ ressing wo@@ unds and other things .
they &apos;d often send an eight year old boy all the way on this tru@@ dge to the market town to get that information and come back , then they &apos;d load the cart .
and this is all about darkness as much as it is about light@@ ness , of course , because otherwise you don &apos;t see these dynamics .
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence -- me and them , and them and me , and our seni@@ ors and us as a force -- all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder .
it &apos;s that little green sli@@ ver on the horizon , which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .
when winter weather set in , the temperatures dropped below freezing . and they stayed there .
it &apos;s a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around , since we only ever get to experience one possibility .
at some point i realized that my mission to photograph &quot; ga@@ ys &quot; was inherently fla@@ wed , because there were a million different sha@@ des of gay .
and by &quot; why &quot; i don &apos;t mean &quot; to make a profit . &quot;
just like today .
they &apos;re tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes .
cut school friday , catch the subway downtown , check out my victims h@@ ang@@ in &apos; around .
we talk about energy independence . we talk about hydrogen cars .
is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different bio@@ chemi@@ stries wherever we find them ?
it &apos;s my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means i collect dead animals .
and then can@@ als were built , and with the same hor@@ se@@ man and the same horse , you could carry ten times as much car@@ go .
this is also , i think , confir@@ med by the fact that the se@@ clu@@ sion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the koran , the very core of islam -- the divine core of islam that all muslims , and equally myself , believe .
&quot; oh , jesus . &quot;
instead , it &apos;s folks getting together to do something for fun , rather than because they were told to , or because they were expecting to make a min@@ t off of it .
the medical personnel who took blood samples from the man never actually told him what they were testing for .
dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain , including in attention , arou@@ sal , reward , and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse , parkinson &apos;s disease , and adhd .
and how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beliefs about the essence of it , affect how it hurts .
the work involves hundreds of different croch@@ et models .
and when we were walking through the narrow alle@@ ys , it was literally impossible not to step in the raw se@@ wage and the garbage alongside the little homes .
and i am sitting by my father &apos;s bed@@ side in hospital , trying to work out whether i should let him drink the one-@@ and-a-@@ half-@@ liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said , &quot; you must make him drink today , &quot; -- my father &apos;s been ni@@ l by mouth for a week -- or whether , by giving him this bottle , i might actually kill him .
they are ru@@ th@@ less , they are honest , but they &apos;re full of energy and fun .
he took women with meta@@ static breast cancer , randomly divided them into two groups .
and critically , what happens in central africa doesn &apos;t stay in central africa .
this is information copied with variation and selection .
oil doesn &apos;t sink , it flo@@ ats .
and i &apos;ve always spoken to women and children wherever i &apos;ve gone .
adding co2 to the air is like throwing another blan@@ ket on the bed .
and for me , athei@@ sm 2.0 is about both , as i say , a respectful and an im@@ pi@@ ous way of going through religions and saying , &quot; what here could we use ? &quot;
according to the u.n. , we speak about 250 million refugees in 2050 .
its initial version was sk@@ ill@@ fully medi@@ ated by senator george mitchell .
and for that reason , polio eradication : it &apos;s the ultimate in equity and it &apos;s the ultimate in social justice .
they got this statement of accompli@@ shment .
but if you look across these space types , you can see that they &apos;re fundamentally different from one another .
but i believe we &apos;re on a path now , when we get to data , that we can di@@ still styles , and tem@@ plates , and formul@@ as , and all these kinds of things , again , that you &apos;ve seen happen in the computer graphics world .
what was so up@@ setting about this new piece of information was not that i was going to have to change the date of my sl@@ um@@ ber party with all of my girl@@ friends , what was most up@@ setting was that this meant that i was not a vir@@ go .
one of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus .
we actually share the same gene@@ alog@@ y with o@@ zz@@ ie the ice@@ man .
and remember , 20 of these speed boats were coming across the adri@@ a@@ tic every single night .
and i looked -- for one of my books , i looked at divorce data in 58 societies .
and this , and then this .
now even after all of this gran@@ ular level of control , do futur@@ eless language speakers seem to save more ?
we don &apos;t know how far it will go , but it &apos;s going on .
we feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write .
if you think about it , the english language has written into it negative associ@@ ations towards the clouds .
it &apos;s a pipe , and it &apos;s written , &quot; this is not a pipe . &quot;
so then they had 18 camels .
and after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation , they &apos;d find fault with almost every word i &apos;ve used , and they &apos;d have to change anything that wasn &apos;t serious enough , and they &apos;d have to change everything that wasn &apos;t 100 percent perfect .
that &apos;s what my home@@ girl is doing .
and i take one of you , or i take someone off the street , and i test them for the disease in question .
what did we find ? we found that six@@ - to 13@@ -@@ year-olds can self-@@ instru@@ ct in a connected environment , ir@@ respe@@ ctive of anything that we could measure .
just 70 miles down@@ stream is the world &apos;s largest fres@@ h@@ water delta , the peac@@ e-@@ ath@@ ab@@ as@@ ca delta , the only one at the jun@@ c@@ ture of all four migr@@ atory fl@@ y@@ ways .
and this is how the revolution was born in tunisia .
someone asked me whether i stuck it in in order to defle@@ ct ire from discussions of gender and naz@@ ism and race and so on . i won &apos;t comment on that .
and it had nothing to do with technical capability .
it &apos;s only 200 of us in this room .
we went and found these incredible cla@@ m beds sitting on the bar@@ ren rock . large cl@@ ams , and when we opened them , they didn &apos;t look like a cla@@ m .
thank you so much . it was an honor to be here .
2,000 films a year ?
okay , glass , record a video .
so then people said , well , how far will it go ?
and david won &apos;t take &quot; no . &quot;
rb : it &apos;s about 25 billion dollars now , in total .
are you ready ? okay .
for that is what we &apos;ll need , as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us , and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet .
and she makes all the deals .
well , it reminds me a little bit of surgery .
but the men had a better idea .
so , a good sort of contrast is chicken mc@@ nuggets .
the fact is , when we do our market research around the world , we see that there &apos;s nearly a universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile .
sure , you got some pleasure out of it , maybe your ego stro@@ ked , maybe you get some professional status in the field .
that accidents , that louis kahn , who talked about accidents , this is another quality of the trickster .
it &apos;s eisenhower bringing moder@@ nity into the countries .
every time you think of a city , you &apos;ve got to think green .
shakespeare being seven ? i never thought of it . i mean , he was seven at some point . he was in somebody &apos;s english class , wasn &apos;t he ? how annoying would that be ?
sobule : my favorite poets took their own lives . or@@ son well@@ es pe@@ aked at twenty-@@ five , below before our eyes . and he sold bad wine . together : why are all our heroes so im@@ perfect ? yeah why do they always bring me down ? sobule : heard bab@@ e ru@@ th was full of mali@@ ce . sweeney : oh .
it &apos;s like , you know , life is not a very well-@@ written story so we have to hire writers to make movies .
together , we can .
now broadmoor is broadmoor hospital .
and i realize the reason why you &apos;re going to do this .
this is pri@@ c@@ eless .
and you can make a very thick , sticky por@@ ridge out of it , which you can use to bind together the charcoal bri@@ quet@@ tes .
and in our offices , we spend a lot of time at work .
&quot; four or five days . &quot;
that is the reality of our modern life .
it caused so much trouble for me .
and all the components are there which are now in common par@@ lan@@ ce , in our vocabulary , you know , 30-@@ odd years later : wind energy , recycling , biomass , solar cells .
but again , a crisis , new partnerships , actors locally , transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning .
we &apos;re pa@@ sting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market .
next olympics , you can bet that oscar , or one of oscar &apos;s success@@ ors , is going to make the time .
and when you ask people about connection , the stories they told me were about dis@@ connection .
this is what it looks like .
mitchell besser : mothers helping mothers fight hiv
first of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
and with al &apos;s blessing , we decided on the spot to turn it into a film , because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having al go around the world , speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time .
we &apos;ve stumbled on another energy bon@@ an@@ za in fossil fuels .
they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes , and they wrote tele@@ grams back to manchester .
what we don &apos;t look for is value for many , while we are generating value for money .
if it &apos;s ellip@@ tical , you can make an a@@ stig@@ matic lens .
and this is what the system involves , a number of sites in the southern hemisphere , shown in those circles .
okay . so maybe i would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it , but i was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn &apos;t want their logos stam@@ ped across the ghet@@ tos of haiti .
okay , open your eyes .
regret doesn &apos;t remind us that we did badly .
it just ben@@ ds by itself beautifully .
i pal@@ med the ball in my large right hand , and when that hand reached the ri@@ m , i felt inv@@ inci@@ ble .
and at the end of the war , there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living .

is it a hearing problem or is it a physi@@ c@@ ality problem ?
when the five minutes were over , i would say , &quot; please sh@@ red the piece of paper .
i &apos;m certain i can see you bl@@ us@@ hing .
but i have a problem with that belief , because i know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems .
it &apos;s kind of common@@ place now , but his argument was -- because he &apos;d been searching for the fossili@@ zed remains of early humans in africa .
and lithium is in sea water . that &apos;s the yellow line .
this is not a philosophy .
i just poli@@ tely raised my hand , and when ms. russell acknowled@@ ged me , i said , in front of my year two class@@ mates , and i quote , &quot; but miss , surely if the diag@@ onal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle , well , the square pe@@ g will pass quite easily through the round hole . &quot;
they also kiss , hold hands , pat one another on the back .
whether or not you think it &apos;s likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe .
as we get more technically driven , the importance of people becomes more than it &apos;s ever been before .
i &apos;m color@@ blind .
so what we &apos;re saying is that scal@@ ability should not become an enemy of sustainability .
so i just recently had to buy life insurance .
and it tells us our reality is continually bran@@ ching into different possibilities , just like a coral .
the story of this little girl : she had been raped by her pat@@ ern@@ al grandfather every day for six months .
you know , maybe we made an error somewhere along the way .
they get near shore . look at these two boats .

i love taking supp@@ lements and being fit , but i can never understand what &apos;s going on in terms of evidence .
because i think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .
so as a final gesture we handed out these bra@@ cele@@ ts to all of you this morning .
we do that for all the words and phr@@ ases that appear in those books , and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing .
the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re-@@ describe ourselves to the world .

the defe@@ ated candidate gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle .

thank you .
and it also became the theme that i felt that i could hold onto , and not have to re-@@ invent myself -- that this theme was large enough to become a life &apos;s work , to become something that i could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are .
this can &apos;t be my mother .

the skin itself is made out of a see-@@ through n@@ ylon mesh , which , if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear , she can light the background and the horse becomes gho@@ st@@ like .
and i want you to hold it there , just for a moment , and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the table@@ top at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness , and allow it to go all the way down to the table@@ top .

it feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways .
and the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve invested in your brand , one bad week can under@@ mine decades of good work .
there are too many of us outside and everybody , just to borrow a bit from hans -- hans rosling , he &apos;s my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention , it &apos;s the problems . but what we really need are african solutions that are appropriate for africa -- looking at the culture , looking at the people , looking at how much money they &apos;ve got .
i wish i was that coordinated .
so who &apos;s the more sophisticated species ?
and when they started ob@@ taining the wri@@ teu@@ ps of those trials through various different means , through freedom of information act requests , through har@@ as@@ sing various different organizations , what they found was in@@ consistent .

now , i &apos;m aware that i should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , i did not see anyone go back unhappy or un@@ heal@@ ed .
they &apos;re going to be enthusiastic .
i just want to end by saying that if adam smith had framed out a theory of the fle@@ a market instead of the free market , what would be some of the principles ?
we should , but it made exactly this point .
and best of all , we were able , in the last 50 years , to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments .
so my parents would go to dinner .
well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
so i asked the people what happened .
and think of things in your life that are binary , one of them is light switches .
it really teaches us who we are , and helps us con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alize ourselves in the world , but it &apos;s really my creativity that &apos;s taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am .

that indeed , a mass extinction was underway in our fields , in our agricultural system .
that was a simple , powerful answer . g@@ w : yes .

so as is the case with simple solutions , of@@ ten@@ times the answer is right in front of your face , and for us it was levers .
the connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer , in that i love to solve problems .
55 years old , and she &apos;s solar-@@ electri@@ fied 200 houses for me in afghanistan .
so the code that mike mon@@ ta@@ gue and the team developed actually puts frequent stop co@@ d@@ ons , so it &apos;s a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire english alphabet with pun@@ ctu@@ ation and numbers .
then take iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to ne@@ da , people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to tehran , iran , and making it difficult for the security services .

bab@@ cock &amp; amp ; wil@@ cox that make nuclear reactors , here &apos;s an integra@@ l fast reactor .
so , for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress , seek good explanations , the ones that can &apos;t be easily varied , while still explaining the phenomena .
well , for a long time , since i was in graduate school , i &apos;ve been messing around making dna chips -- that is , printing dna on glass .
the world is full of wonder .

we won &apos;t call for the march of millions .
and these stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12 , 15 miles wide , and they are black holes . and they are go@@ b@@ bling up everything around them , including light , which is why we can &apos;t see them .
this is not that they took me -- the work didn &apos;t take me -- i made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world .
you don &apos;t have enough time .
part of it is that these materials are macro@@ scop@@ ic in structure , but they &apos;re formed at the nano@@ scale .
puppe@@ ts is the way we communicate .
but that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil , just a little handful of soil , in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there .
the question that we wanted to ask was : could emotion spread , in a more sustained way than riots , across time and involve large numbers of people , not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car ?
and the wolfram stuff -- i was taking notes and i was writing down all the search words i could use , because i think that &apos;s going to go on in my autism lectures .
i was told backstage that i have 18 minutes .
because that has happened to me .
and we don &apos;t have a birth@@ right to just use that up as fast as we are , i think .
&quot; worrying solves nothing . &quot;
the y chromosome , the piece of dna that makes men men , traces a purely pat@@ ern@@ al line of des@@ cent .
for most western young women of today , being called a feminist is an insu@@ lt .
but they don &apos;t ever get used like that .
i don &apos;t know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
and your front foot , the way it grabs it , is -- i &apos;d seen someone slide on the back of the board like that , and i was like , &quot; how can i get it over ? &quot;
and you can &apos;t tell the story about pollin@@ ators -- bees , bats , humming@@ birds , butter@@ flies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-@@ evolved over 50 million years .
i had an infrastructure . i had this deep layer , where it was like , oh my gosh , it &apos;s just your foot .

we humans are inventing a new fire , not dug from below , but flowing from above ; not scarce , but boun@@ ti@@ ful ; not local , but everywhere ; not transi@@ ent , but permanent ; not costly , but free .
there is so many interests . there &apos;s money . there &apos;s political power .
so this just sum@@ mari@@ zes it . &quot; over billions of years , on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable , wonderful and fragile .
in short , when we &apos;re thinking like academics , we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines , like computers or cars , but when we rever@@ t to being human we behave more like bas@@ il fa@@ w@@ l@@ ty , who , we remember , thr@@ as@@ hed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn &apos;t start on gour@@ met night .
here &apos;s the apple marketing video .
i also liked the kind of intellectual mach@@ o games .
now don &apos;t be shy .
this suggests that the same script , the indus script , could be used to write different languages .
we are on a planet of seven billion people , five billion mobile sub@@ scrip@@ tions .
so i got a scholarship to st. lawrence university , up@@ state new york ; finished that . and then after that i went to harvard graduate school ; finished that . and then i worked in dc a little bit : i wrote a book for national geographic and taught history , u.s. history .
now , i know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen , so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers , the fibonacci numbers .
we do similar things with ice cor@@ es .
it sounds like , he says , &quot; god , i want you to make me famous . &quot;
by the way , these can be men as well .
it &apos;s sitting there saying , ah , i &apos;m going to memor@@ ize all the things that are going on : where i &apos;ve been , people i &apos;ve seen , things i &apos;ve heard , and so on .
and as an experiment , because i da@@ un@@ t@@ ingly create a task for myself of re@@ creating a saturn v launch for this particular movie , because i put it out there , i felt a little nervous about it , so i need to do an experiment and bring a group of people like this in a projection room and play this stock footage , and when i played this stock footage , i simply wanted to find out what people remembered , what was memorable about it ?
and finally , india has had the dee@@ pen@@ ing of its democracy .
so whenever i fill up my gas , i think of that liter , and how much carbon .
one day in 18@@ 19 , 3,000 miles off the coast of chile , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean , 20 american sail@@ ors watched their ship flood with seawater .
and in the last 200 years , something else has happened .
one of them is the requi@@ rement for econom@@ ical earth-@@ to-@@ space transport .
the walls were blue , the windows were blue , the sidewalk out front was painted blue .
my search is always to find ways to chron@@ ic@@ le , to share and to document stories about people , just everyday people .
five people jumped and died , other people were killed by the smoke .
prices for ar@@ vs , the drugs needed to treat hiv , cost about 12,000 &#91; dollars &#93; per patient per year .
because if you look at a brain with your naked eye , you don &apos;t really see how complex it is , but when you use a microscope , finally the hidden complexity is revealed .
to which i have to say , here &apos;s the thing with the singing cats . that always happens .
and i &apos;d say this knowledge is over-@@ fitting to past data .
now , as a business professor , and as any business professor would tell you , an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organi@@ zational structure , good incentives , a solid identity and good brand management .
we looked at their desire to cooperate .
in other words , your perfect non-lethal weapon is something that &apos;s perfect for abuse .
i knew nothing about wo@@ fford and even less about metho@@ dis@@ m , but i was reas@@ su@@ red on the first day that i taught at wo@@ fford college to find , among the audi@@ tors in my classroom , a 9@@ 0-@@ year-old hung@@ arian , surrounded by a be@@ vy of middle-@@ aged european women who seemed to function as an ent@@ ou@@ rage of rhin@@ ema@@ iden@@ s .
i have two lo@@ a@@ ves of bread here .
everybody likes to have their own animal that they named .
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion , it &apos;s because you realize that you yourself and your pa@@ ins and pleas@@ ures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence .
and even though they &apos;re used in labs to promote human lives , they &apos;re also considered pe@@ sts .
but what &apos;s interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this .
my favorite topic is short@@ cuts .
we &apos;re going to win because we don &apos;t play their dirty games .
the soci@@ alism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swis@@ s-@@ bank soci@@ alism , which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and pl@@ under africa &apos;s treas@@ u@@ ries for depos@@ it in switzerland .
i was walking by . the guy goes , &quot; p@@ sst . hab@@ i@@ bi , my friend . &quot;
and it lay precisely in that in@@ sati@@ able curiosity , that ir@@ repres@@ sible desire to know , no matter what the subject , no matter what the cost , even at a time when the keepers of the do@@ om@@ s@@ day clock are willing to bet even money that the human race won &apos;t be around to imagine anything in the year 2100 , a sc@@ ant 93 years from now .
we wondered : does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one ?
well , the evidence is , unfortunately , am@@ ple .
this was flying around in the party last night , and -- -- you can see how it just can fly around , and you can sp@@ y on anybody you want .
this is actually two of my favorites : the p@@ in-@@ board thom yor@@ ke and a lego thom yor@@ ke .
i think this was truly fantastic .
this is one of her songs .
and i could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me .
and they also have electricity .
the feeling i had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement , of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility , of making sure everything is safe .
but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will un@@ stit@@ ch you . &quot;
he had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-@@ off hypothesis .
and let &apos;s now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion .
we need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring prac@@ tition@@ ers , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with re@@ formers in government .
you need three of them , so that if one of them goes bad , you know which one it is .
it means things happen .
and the other remarkable thing is it &apos;s , i think , the highest status of car ownership .
and then slowly , the trees start taking over , bringing in produce from the fruits , from the timber , from the fuel wood .
i &apos;m incredibly excited about that .
now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
this is the craft that was going on , but there are a few colle@@ ctors who also collect art which can de@@ preci@@ ate .
because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions .
it &apos;s not only innocent , who i told you about in zimbabwe , but defen@@ ders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
and , secondly , to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope .
the glaciers are actually leaving us .
so , whatever , whi@@ che@@ ver of those renewables you pick , the message is , whatever mix of those renewables you &apos;re using , if you want to power the u.k. on them , you &apos;re going to need to cover something like 20 percent or 25 percent of the country with those renewables .
so it &apos;s intuitive , and it works pretty well .
it &apos;s a win-win trade : i give you phosphorus , and you feed me .
i happen to believe it was a great error .
and no matter what i say , you cannot un@@ tie me from the mast .
you think that &apos;s not an issue going forward ?
and so i said , &quot; did you just move into this office ? &quot;
first , we have to provide the fuel ; second , press the acceler@@ ator pedal ; third , steer the car .
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you .
it &apos;s actually a sensible way of cop@@ ing with the inevi@@ tability of aging .
i also started medi@@ tating for the first time in my life in bali .
so my co@@ authors and i have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to ass@@ ist people &apos;s imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .
jim ax@@ el@@ rod : forget the empire state building or the statue of liberty .
and what i &apos;ve noticed is -- first of all , you get an incredible amount of email .
we ask the question -- the whole debate in the western world is about the level of tax@@ ation .
but i &apos;m not going to the east , because i don &apos;t know swahili .

and you want a leader who inspir@@ es and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen . right ?
we &apos;re going to win because we have dreams .
it &apos;s basically efficient brain@@ stor@@ ming , and when i visited david to learn about his research , he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method : powerpoint .
michael sandel : takes the intrinsic incentive away .
it &apos;s the place where you &apos;re deciding right now you probably aren &apos;t going to order the steak for dinner .
so we asked a question to the parliament : do poor have heads ?
you &apos;re not asked .
fracking came out in &apos; 47 , and don &apos;t believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the department of energy 30 years ago developed fracking .
and they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say , &quot; sir , yes , sir , &quot; and things like gren@@ ade toss and weapons care and maintenance .
and the best thing is , they &apos;ll also last for more than 20 years .
that was the family business .
he accidentally fell through the ice into the sea .
you know , i &apos;m from bri@@ zzy , which is a great city to live in , but let &apos;s be honest -- it &apos;s not exactly the cultural hub of the southern hemisphere .
today i &apos;m going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep , so dark , so un@@ explored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon .
so if news is anything to go by , the u.s. is right there with zimbabwe , right ?
we had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the inter@@ locking crises .
i have to tell you a little bit about my family .
we now have the money , given these low prices , to distribute aids drugs all over the world to people we cannot pres@@ ently reach .
when i was seven i went to summer camp .
but the perfect tools aren &apos;t going to help us if we can &apos;t face each other and give and receive fear@@ lessly , but , more important , to ask without shame .
and we will soon see china coming up in the very far end corner here .
we don &apos;t replace teachers , by the way .
did you hear the lyri@@ cs ?
in the meanwhile , the old ment@@ ality with a capital o , was represented by his father , the head of the nigerian bank , warning the cia that his own son was about to attack , and this warning fell on deaf ears .
is that your final answer ?
once in a while , our fears can predict the future .
so really what the ice does is it acts like a garden .
we don &apos;t realize it , but it &apos;s actually a record of that entire ecology .
but people prevail@@ ed on us , and we got together , and it &apos;s been transformative in what i do , absolutely transformative .
in fact , i loved the movie , how they dupli@@ cated all my projects . that &apos;s the geek side .
i was born and raised here in india , and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the a@@ un@@ ties and un@@ cles who would bend down , pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all , &quot; poor things . you only have three daughters .
and we &apos;re very careful about the brains that we do take .
i &apos;m live . all right . there we go .
how do you know ?
maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the berlin wall , where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication .
but these are really high-@@ performance athle@@ tic animals .
that &apos;s all i have . thank you very much .
and i want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for ration@@ ality .
and there is something else i believe in the back of your mind you also know .
and for the future it won &apos;t serve us .
to explore this question , my student , sig@@ gy ad@@ al@@ gei@@ r@@ s@@ son , did a study where we brought human participants , people , into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator .
i read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs , and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called &quot; productive paran@@ o@@ ia , &quot; which meant that these people , instead of dis@@ missing their fears , these people read them closely , they studied them , and then they translated that fear into preparation and action .
so when you think about the improbable nature of what i &apos;m going to tell you in the next few minutes , just remember , we came from stuff on planet earth .
it &apos;s the real that we touch -- the door , the window , the threshold , the bed -- such pro@@ sa@@ ic objects . and yet , i try , in every building , to take that virtual world , which is so en@@ ig@@ matic and so rich , and create something in the real world .
i learned about compassion .
stro@@ mato@@ li@@ tes were the first to ex@@ hal@@ e oxygen .
thank you very much .
and this one , this one goes around in a human lifetime .
well , let &apos;s start there with the phrase &quot; all david has is this s@@ ling , &quot; because that &apos;s the first mistake that we make .
now he &apos;s really pretty sick . he needs help eating , he needs help getting dressed , he doesn &apos;t really know where he is or when it is , and it &apos;s been really , really hard .
now , he needed access@@ ories .
but the first theory is : it must be the shape .
so what we &apos;re going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or , really , some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors .
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
but then it gets better . day 96 he goes home .
how do we solve it ?
teenage boys lived in isolation , their bodies covered with white clay .
this is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other .
what we now know is that if we treat the animal with a patho@@ genic bacterium -- a multi-@@ dru@@ g-@@ resistant patho@@ genic bacterium -- in the same time we give our anti-@@ quor@@ um sensing molecule , in fact , the animal lives .
and i know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but i also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t op@@ pos@@ ites .
i would consider the studio more like a laboratory .
most of the talks that you &apos;ve heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something , they are experts , they know what &apos;s going on .
i couldn &apos;t find a teacher . what i did find was a friend that they had , a 2@@ 2-@@ year-old girl who was an accoun@@ tant and she played with them all the time .
co2 is the ex@@ hal@@ ing breath of our civilization , literally .
you can consciously contract the muscles in your chee@@ ks .
they are not cau@@ sal , they are actually supporting factors .
in the future you &apos;re going to be checking all your vital signs , all your vital signs : your heart rhythm , your blood pressure , your oxygen , your temperature , etc .
so they would come up with all these ideas .
and on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
life is temptation . it &apos;s all about yiel@@ ding , resi@@ sting , yes , no , now , later , impul@@ sive , reflective , present focus and future focus .
i was there in 2003 .
did it mean that venus had an i@@ on@@ o@@ sphere ?
and i looked at him -- he didn &apos;t know any other english than that , but we didn &apos;t need english , no , no , no , no , no .
five symmetries and then of course the zer@@ oth symmetry where i just pick it up and leave it where it is .
this is a scan through the human for@@ ear@@ m . it &apos;s then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal the cellular structure . i have these in my office .

to compen@@ sa@@ te this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understand@@ ably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , re@@ gressi@@ ve side , repres@@ sive side , restri@@ ctive side of the cultural context .
i saw this leaf@@ let and it said , &quot; there are millions of slaves in the world today . &quot;
and in one generation , they &apos;re going from hunger , and all of the de@@ tri@@ mental health effects of hunger , to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation .
we see it start . and we see it grow up to the stable state the wars around the world look like .
i don &apos;t have my own plane yet .

she was so app@@ alled by what was happening in austri@@ a as a result of the first world war and what was happening to children who were part of the defe@@ ated families of austri@@ a , that in britain she wanted to take action , but she had to go house to house , leaf@@ let to leaf@@ let , to get people to attend a r@@ ally in the royal albert hall that eventually gave birth to save the children , an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world .
if we could expand our definition of death to en@@ comp@@ ass life , we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear .
now , back to my projections .
so , she &apos;s got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mou@@ se@@ trap of need@@ le-@@ sharp teeth in order to attract in some uns@@ us@@ pe@@ cting prey .
and for that to happen , you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected , to enable this kind of innovation , as this liber@@ tarian tells us , between these two creative cultures , a commercial and a sharing culture .

and i &apos;ve taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar , just from milk .
this seems pre@@ historic now , but this was where we were with technology .
so , they put the cells in cultures , chicken cells , dumped the virus on it , and it would pile up , and they would say , this is malig@@ nant and this is normal .

i mean the i@@ pl had 2.@@ 3 billion dollars before a ball was bow@@ led , 1.@@ 6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franch@@ ises that were putting in money . and then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the west , right ? because we are setting up lea@@ gues .
and he asked me several questions , of which many were , &quot; why ?
they could be quite mild .
beyond this hand is a world of vas@@ eline .
this is a piece that i did for the guardian newspaper in the u.k .
when he says , &quot; come to me that i might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the bea@@ sts of the field , &quot; the phrase &quot; come to me &quot; is a hint also of his vulnerability .
my children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other .
so out of my hospital bed , i asked my husband to start taking notes , and a few months later , the marathon was born .

that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that popcorn .
anybody that &apos;s selling their excess eggs at the garden gate , perfectly legally , to their neighbors , we &apos;ve stuck on there . we started with four , and we &apos;ve now got 64 on , and the result of that was that people were then going into shops asking for a local tod@@ mor@@ den egg , and the result of that was , some farmers upp@@ ed the amount of flo@@ cks they got of free range birds , and then they went on to meat birds , and although these are really , really small steps , that increasing local economic confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways , and we now have farmers doing cheese and they &apos;ve upp@@ ed their flo@@ cks and rare breed pigs , they &apos;re doing pa@@ sti@@ es and pies and things that they would have never done before .
so what is the intuitive , but in@@ correct assumption , that &apos;s kept us from understanding brains ?
water resources are running low .
i actually did research to find out the first use of the word &quot; technology . &quot;
so i was scared .
and you come home , and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in north america and in europe have dropped their leaves .
all right ? but now we get into some harder questions .
and in place of that , what happens is that islam@@ ism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian , which is quite stri@@ dent , which is quite anti-@@ western , and which wants to shape society based on a utop@@ ian vision .
that &apos;s the warm up .
but the advantage of that little bit of social dis@@ comfort is the fact that , when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances , we &apos;re super@@ b , we &apos;re the best on the planet .

we &apos;ve developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains , because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars -- and say , &quot; where does your stuff come from ? &quot; they say , &quot; supp@@ liers . &quot;
i lived the high-@@ life .
yeah , i walk around night@@ clubs all night like this .
how many of you once in your -- you were a kid , you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone ?
so that allows cells to oo@@ ze along in the right directions .
when i became a parent , i figured , you know what ?
how do you get to build those relationships ?
mystery number two : women have been in the olympics for quite some time now , but one thing that &apos;s remarkable about all women spr@@ inters -- they all suck ; they &apos;re terrible .
i was two years older than my sister at the time -- i mean , i &apos;m two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do , and i wanted to play war .
and actually in the period through which we &apos;ve been working over the last 18 years -- partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics -- actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world .
so , tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place .
sorry , i hate to carry on ...
but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .
now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters , because gone are the hor@@ rid conditions inside a sports arena or a gym@@ n@@ asi@@ um , where people are cra@@ mmed on these c@@ ots inside .
and i also said to her , &quot; now these so@@ ws . i mean , you may have noticed there , the so@@ w doesn &apos;t look to be in the thro@@ es of ec@@ st@@ asy . &quot;
here you have sub-saharan africa , south asia , east asia , arab states , east europe , latin america , and oecd .
we don &apos;t have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
they decided that wasn &apos;t good enough , so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this , and they adapted it for ethiopia .
the cat likes this version better .
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .
other than the fact that they can &apos;t tell directions , and they have very strange breeding habits , how do you actually work with these things ?
now to conce@@ al the shape , we changed the aspect ratio a little bit .
living in africa is to be on the edge , metaphor@@ ically , and quite literally when you think about connectivity before 2008 .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit more about this .
but psych@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cs really haven &apos;t had a huge impact on the media business .
the next great stage , which all of you are so familiar with : the massive information revolution .
the two human dna sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently .
and the atoms themselves are quite violent , but if you fire las@@ ers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency , an atom will briefly absorb those phot@@ ons and tend to slow down .
this is a huge collaboration .
and all of a sudden , indian sport had awa@@ ken@@ ed to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
when i was a kid growing up in the south bronx , inner@@ -@@ city ghet@@ to in new york , i was surrounded by evil , as all kids are who grew up in an inner city .
i know theater can improve the quality of people &apos;s lives , and i know theater can heal .
and lo and behold , we gave birth to the first edible wall in new york city .
you notice that there is no pro@@ scen@@ ium , the balcon@@ ies have been raised up , there are no seats , the floor in the auditorium is flat .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a theory right now .
alex , in some ways , said it best .
it was the technique of feynman diagrams .
it &apos;s a toy ; it &apos;s called a &quot; finger bla@@ ster . &quot;
it has shr@@ unk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more gran@@ ular understanding of the material world , and this gran@@ ular understanding has generated re@@ ams of data that our brains can no longer compre@@ hend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
it &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age .
switch antibiotics : so they switched to another antibio@@ tic , tamiflu .
they &apos;re even models in medicine , and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human .
i predict scientifically 74 percent of you will go for bananas .
all done in the lab .
because the zetas organization was founded in treas@@ on , they lost some of the link@@ ages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine , but what they did have , and this is again based on their military origin , was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to super@@ v@@ ise and operate across many , many markets very effectively , which is the essence of what a chain of command see@@ ks to do .
i &apos;m left-@@ handed , and so i draw .
i go in , tail comes off .
so , let &apos;s now say why this is relevant . why is it relevant ?
it took 23 hours . i did it with my neuro@@ surgeon .
but if trees can create art , if they can en@@ circle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like ad@@ dic@@ tions , like racism , that can also change .
and the team is expert , and the team is courageous , and bri@@ mming with innovation and scientific discovery , as is true with any major expedition on the planet .
do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it ?
it is a moment in time .
the picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mu@@ g shots .
you only have to make one decision , and that is : are you going to use the white version for very good tedtalks , about creativity , human genius ?
it connects the poles of our lives back together , the positive and the negative , and it sends a little current of life back into us .
i spoke about this before , and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said , &quot; okay , what can you do ? &quot;
we &apos;ve gone a little bit beyond light stage 5 . this is light stage 6 , and we &apos;re looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies .
and you can sc@@ roll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have .
now , how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton ?
i witnessed my first fra@@ ck job at border texas in 1953 .
and we published before knowing that , because we figured it was so beautiful , it &apos;s gotta be right !
you &apos;re like , &quot; you know ? i think that &apos;s an animal car@@ c@@ ass behind her . &quot;
on the cardiac side , pac@@ e@@ makers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don &apos;t need to train an interven@@ tional car@@ di@@ ologist to place them .
i think the e@@ am@@ es@@ es are wonderful examples of experimentation .
based on a lot of evidence for mind@@ fulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being .
we let the doctors make all the decisions , take the driver &apos;s seat .
and we need to think very dis@@ passionately about the compar@@ ative advantages of small-scale and large-scale .
we &apos;re on the grid . we &apos;re not proud of it .
also , they operate at high temperatures , and the fuel is mol@@ ten , so they can &apos;t melt down , but in the event that the reactor ever went out of toler@@ ances , or you lost off-@@ site power in the case of something like fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , there &apos;s a dump tank .

what i did here , i just put like 10 feet &#91; of &#93; paper then put a co@@ con@@ ut rope , and just bur@@ nt it .
but have you seen anything in nature , an animal that has three legs ?

and if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our bu@@ tts and volunte@@ ered as much time as we could , we would change this world , we would save this world .
well , &quot; responsive electrical stimulation &quot; means that we sense , at a place in your brain which is called an &quot; epilep@@ tic focus , &quot; which is where the epilep@@ tic sei@@ z@@ ure begins -- we sense there , that it &apos;s going to happen , and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot , which er@@ ases the er@@ rant signal so that you don &apos;t get the clinical manife@@ stations of the migraine heada@@ che .
they &apos;ve just institu@@ ted dynamic pricing .
when my son was four in england -- actually he was four everywhere , to be honest .
it won &apos;t be easy .
so , several years ago , i decided to look into the brain and study this madness .
she said , &quot; oh it &apos;s wonderful . how did you do that ? &quot;
and even down in grade school , things have changed .
now , dolphins are natural acou@@ sti@@ cians .
might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans ?
the questions i would like to talk about are : one , where did we come from ?
what do we know ? what do people do in these kinds of situations ?
whether it be your business , your contribution to society , money -- whatever it is for you -- your body , your family .
remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you , keeping you healthy .
here is a commercial version from new mexico called the hy@@ peri@@ on , and another one from oregon called n@@ us@@ c@@ ale .
third section is this idea of not knowing , of consciously putting yourself backwards .
i bought five grams . 10 dollars . 10 dollars ! i said , &quot; what &apos;s in this ? &quot;
that &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
there was lots of money and repu@@ tations at stake .
now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon -- there is good news , amazing news , in the 21st century , and that is that , almost out of nowhere , there has come into being an anti-@@ genocide movement , an anti-@@ genocide constitu@@ ency , and one that looks dest@@ ined , in fact , to be permanent .
everybody who has ri@@ dden the new york subway system will be familiar with these signs ?
seriously , and it worked . and yes , that was actually a rented sheep , so i had to return that in the morning , but it served well for a day .
i &apos;m sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries , especially those in sub-saharan africa , so attractive for these hiv clinical trials ?
so i turn myself on when , i turn my desires , i wake up when ...
the war is so worrying at present , with court cases coming up in one state after another , that i felt i had to say something about it .
he gets more and more and more famous , except if you look in german .
korea shows you what &apos;s possible in education .
it was a glorious experience . &quot; &quot; i believe it turned out for the best . &quot;
they &apos;re dynamic .
and i said , &quot; there &apos;s one thing that we have in common in this room , all of us together , whether republican or demo@@ crat , or whoever . &quot;
i knew i wasn &apos;t ready . i knew i had to quit . &quot;
and they reflect a dich@@ ot@@ omy of art and delight on left and the right ; tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom .
and that made a huge impact on me when i was doing this research .
and i felt for the first time in my life that i was part of something bigger than myself .
let &apos;s take a look at win@@ ni@@ pe@@ g . how many of you , in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fi@@ b , or a big one ? how many have told a little lie out there ?

we went in and sat down at the booth , and the wa@@ it@@ ress came over , made a big com@@ motion over tipper .
and the third is to aug@@ ment memory by creating a visual persi@@ stence .
the fact of the matter is that it just isn &apos;t true , and it &apos;s easy to think that it is true , but in order to see it in another way , in order to see that actually texting is a miracul@@ ous thing , not just energetic , but a miracul@@ ous thing , a kind of emergent complexity that we &apos;re seeing happening right now , we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is , in which case , one thing that we see is that texting is not writing at all .
little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
now as it turns out -- thank you .
now look at that plastic chair .
you can see they &apos;re very blas@@ é and kind of eff@@ or@@ tless .
and i was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publi@@ cations i was seeing felt sou@@ ll@@ ess and cold .
it &apos;s a very puri@@ fying experience .
it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .
what is this ? &quot; i don &apos;t want to swear on the web .
we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in israel that said we will end oil .
whenever he eats the pit vi@@ per he gets this little ven@@ om rush .
fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
bf : good .
we cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth .
and i thought , &quot; yeah , you know , this slowing down thing really does work . &quot;
and high among them is education , because education , in a way , dis@@ lo@@ cates very many people from their natural talents .
in other words , men and women were wor@@ shi@@ ping all together .
so this video was taken at aqu@@ ari@@ us under@@ sea laboratory four miles off the coast of key lar@@ go , about 60 feet below the surface .

it &apos;s going to depend whether they &apos;re inner@@ -@@ city or rural .
it l@@ eng@@ th@@ ens , shor@@ tens and ben@@ ds really easily in response to internal or external forces .
and they , then , never get any positive feedback .
this is ky@@ lie , her sister , who &apos;s now a doctor , on the right .
and that is the truth . and that &apos;s what i try to get out .
many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously , putting a lot of work and care into the details .
now , the problem of human diversity , like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-@@ questions .
so , for example , we could use tru@@ ckers &apos; purch@@ ases of fuel .
but the kind of virtually inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ous nature of its ere@@ ction , and its being there , almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished , is part of its extraordinary -- i don &apos;t know if beauty is the word -- but presence .
if you don &apos;t know what those are , they &apos;re just the &quot; brains . &quot;
then recently &quot; rock band &quot; has been a big hit .
that &apos;s the story of civilization .
until one day in ninth grade , when i was standing with a number of the football players .
i think there was a gall@@ up survey out recently that said something like , in america , trust in banks is at an all-@@ time low , it &apos;s something like 21 percent .
i mean , my all-@@ time classic is another &quot; come here &quot; one .
the chalk itself &apos;s composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor , so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff , and then you have that milli@@ meter-@@ thick red layer , and then you have black rock .
so on top of l-@@ dop@@ a , they gave these kids a serotonin pre@@ cursor drug , and they &apos;re effectively normal now .
this is commerce in kenya , right along the train tracks , so close to the train tracks that the mer@@ chan@@ ts sometimes have to pull the mer@@ chand@@ ise out of the way .
but let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like .
and watch the change as it goes into this long dry season .
but i didn &apos;t want you to miss out on this one , because this , well , it &apos;s called &quot; por@@ tion-@@ controlled meat cuts . &quot;
it had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m. &quot;
this is a sole in newcastle .
and i got a lot of them during what &apos;s been going on throughout this conference , almost everything that &apos;s been going on .
if we can put those two together in a safe space , get them to work together , we can deliver public goods right now , or in extremely short supply .
it sure used to be a lot easier to be from iceland , because until a couple of years ago , people knew hardly anything about us , and i could basically come out here and say only good things about us .
so to address this problem , i put together a team of international researchers in switzerland , denmark and the u.k .
bertie county is kind of a prime example in the de@@ mise of rural america .
maybe you &apos;re hun@@ ching , crossing your legs , maybe wra@@ pping your an@@ kles .
we can often do until our kids grow up .

what don &apos;t you like about this ?
it means that i can choose a car exactly for that particular trip .
what &apos;s interesting , again , is that it self-@@ assem@@ bles .
so , a problem in explaining how children learn language , a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don &apos;t make gram@@ ma@@ tical errors , and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which construc@@ tions .
many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution , and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods .
so , completely irrational , you would think .
well , not@@ with@@ standing the glo@@ omy pictures from the middle east , darfur , iraq , elsewhere , there is a lon@@ ger-@@ term trend that does represent some good news .
and my first thought was , &quot; i &apos;ve lost it .
occasionally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies .
this car , which is my mini , doesn &apos;t look that safe .
and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
but it is important to recognize that north korea and south korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations , but also in the deeper senses of understand@@ ings , norms , culture , values and beliefs .
and of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consu@@ mer@@ ism in our society .
and i think some people may have mis@@ understood .
and that &apos;s because it &apos;s such an en@@ ra@@ ging , yet engaging place to be .
but this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we &apos;re just pe@@ d@@ aling fu@@ ri@@ ously to get back to where we were a year or two ago , and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for , or whether this is a moment to jump ahead , to re@@ boot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway .
so this one would have to be bigger ?
most independent media was shut down .
but this monit@@ ors food , it monit@@ ors activity and tracks weight .
but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date .
we can destroy a river , and we can bring it back to life .
and it has the it@@ ur@@ i forest itself -- about 1,@@ 300 species of plants , so far known .
personally , i can &apos;t afford the luxury of arrogan@@ ce anymore , let alone the luxury of certainty .
and i &apos;m teaching myself to kn@@ it , which so far i can kn@@ it a blob .
you get 12 touri@@ sts packed into a zo@@ diac , floating in these icy waters , and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pon@@ to@@ on .

unfortunately , these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they &apos;re vulnerable .
that &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish i was .
sam@@ anth@@ a power tells a story of a complicated hero , sergio vi@@ ei@@ ra de mell@@ o . this un diplomat walked a thin moral line , negotiating with the world &apos;s worst dictat@@ ors to help their people survive crisis . it &apos;s a compelling story told with a fi@@ ery passion .
oh , and here &apos;s one other thing .
this was something more than that . he ignored it .
so long-@@ distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
so , these are the cities of the future , and we have to engage them .
when we want to influence somebody , we &apos;ve got to know what already influences them .
if they &apos;re real boxes , there &apos;s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , &quot; right , well .
i didn &apos;t want to be a sty@@ list in this way .

this is in technology . this is in the area of politics , where pun@@ di@@ ts , the cia , mi@@ 6 always get it wrong .
your girl is here .
ladies and gentlemen , and more importantly , mo bro@@ s and mo si@@ st@@ as — — for the next 17 minutes , i &apos;m going to share with you my movember journey , and how , through that journey , we &apos;ve re@@ defined charity , we &apos;re re@@ defining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world , and i hope , through that process , that i inspire you to create something significant in your life , something significant that will go on and make this world a better place .
now , i haven &apos;t yet given you a definition .
you cannot , in the same gesture , shake hand and give a blow .
they were saying , why &apos;s it moving ?
once it &apos;s completed , i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects .
there is no plan b right now .
six and a half years later , a hundred and eigh@@ ty researchers , they have some amazing developments in the lab , and i will show you three of those today , such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead , we can generate all the energy we need right where we are , clean@@ ly , safely , and cheap@@ ly .
there was much i wished to say to abed .
you heard about neuro@@ modul@@ ators earlier .
you could even get your own hive if you want .
there were maps and minutes from meetings where the parents were sla@@ gging each other off .
we wanted to get a temperature probe , we stuck it in there , looked at it -- it pe@@ gged off scale .
and that , as indi@@ cated by the white line , occurred 46 days before the peak of the epidemic .
people are inspired by moral heroes .
j@@ t : if i give enough movement in the sculpture , and the actor moves their head , you feel like it &apos;s alive .
this is keith har@@ ing looked at statistically .
it is not harvard .
whereas on the right , where there was a lot of activity , people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief , and said she deser@@ ved a lot less blame for causing the accident .
imagine hearing great , de@@ par@@ ted pi@@ ani@@ sts play again today , just as they would in person . john q. walker demonstrates how recor@@ dings can be analyzed for precise key@@ strokes and pedal motions , then played back on computer-@@ controlled grand pian@@ os .
now one of the challenges in polio , still , is marketing , but it might not be what you think .
and we thought we &apos;d probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture . but as you can see , there &apos;s seven out of 20 had a change which was very high .
women and children , especially the poor , are at the bottom .
she knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t go to school .
it is an essential pill@@ ar to this country &apos;s recovery .
we have no idea what they do .
so , now i have the first of four pro@@ positions i &apos;m going to leave with you about how you simpli@@ fy the law : you &apos;ve got to judge law mainly by its effect on the broader society , not individual dispu@@ tes .
they &apos;re getting software capacity out there but they &apos;re not actually flying around the world .
and of course , you might suspect that ni@@ co@@ de@@ mus jones is r.@@ j. ell@@ ory .
a number of years ago , he tried to ski all the way to the north pole .
and if there are things that we see that we don &apos;t like about our culture , then we have a choice .
and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person .
flying but@@ tr@@ esses , just as in a cathedral , help streng@@ then the cro@@ wn of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time .
and they would just kind of throw the bu@@ ckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away , and of course it never really would go away .
what i am always thinking about is what this session is about , which is called simplicity .
and what &apos;s the weight of the equipment you &apos;re carrying ?
nm : i &apos;m not tuned . hold on .
and what i &apos;m so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in asia , in the middle east , in latin america and east europe that &#91; are &#93; reducing with this rate .
but just keep staring at it .
now , they &apos;re all the exact same except this one obviously has a sta@@ in@@ less steel spike sticking out of it .
we have no choice but to embrace that reality .
has the human mind changed ?
i had figured out the exact amount of shrin@@ ka@@ ge i achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3d li@@ th@@ ography master of this , which i will polish , then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze . or : there are several people who own origin@@ als , and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them , hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds , maybe to take a picture , or even to pull out the hand-@@ held laser scanner that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box , and could maybe , without even touching their bird , i swear , get a perfect 3d scan . and i &apos;m even willing to sign pages saying that i &apos;ll never let anyone else have it , except for me in my office , i promise .
a deer free@@ zes very , very still , pois@@ ed to run away .
so they &apos;re cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pa@@ sting them up .
the officer who earlier den@@ ied involvement pe@@ cks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the co@@ co@@ a to be s@@ mug@@ gled .
so , here &apos;s the first story .
this is a high-@@ altitude helium balloon .
that was the original intent , was it not ?
so this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family , and through that , maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans , that &apos;s this little idea that turned into kiva .
there &apos;s a famous harvard business school study on a woman named hei@@ di ro@@ i@@ zen .
in fact , if you look back , human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-@@ evolving for quite a long time .
at this point i think we have a little impres@@ si@@ oni@@ stic film that was made especially for this occasion .
so we had to create one .
the moment the fe@@ cal matter hits the rotating turbine , you can start shooting at people .
they are now buying cars .
i wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle .
you can make a lot of change . you can get roads built .
maybe as people , because especially in israel , and maybe that little thing can change something .
the stu@@ pen@@ d@@ ous time sp@@ ans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the american bible belt , anyway -- but most people , even those who are familiar with evolution , aren &apos;t mind@@ ful that even more time lies ahead .
that &apos;s the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year .
we don &apos;t have such an arti@@ fact for the indus script .
that &apos;s the easy thing .
so what &apos;s happening is , as the shape is moving over space-time , it &apos;s twi@@ sting . and the direction it &apos;s twi@@ sting as it moves is what particle we see . so it would be -- the size of the e8 shape , how does that relate to the electron ?
one is that -- it &apos;s called &quot; ge@@ ce@@ kon@@ du &quot; in turkish , which means &quot; built overnight , &quot; and if you build your house overnight in turkey , you can &apos;t be evi@@ cted without due process of law , if they don &apos;t catch you during the night .
he &apos;s a man , a servant , an older servant looking at this younger servant , saying , &quot; look at me . i want to warn you about what you &apos;re about to go through . please look at me . &quot;
we are doing the same with the insurance sector .
it wouldn &apos;t do anything but press this bar .
but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric life@@ times -- much longer than before -- because they &apos;re levi@@ tated .
i was trying to remind myself of the simple , universal , little pleas@@ ures that we all love , but we just don &apos;t talk about enough -- things like wa@@ i@@ ters and wa@@ it@@ resses who bring you free re@@ fills without asking , being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding , wearing warm underwear from just out of the dr@@ yer , or when cas@@ hi@@ ers open up a new check@@ -@@ out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line -- even if you were last at the other line , s@@ wo@@ op right in there .
one is the body channel .
does your brain have to send little pa@@ inters in there ?
one day , i bought a yo-yo .
and they are working with me up to today .
and you ought to come and see it -- it &apos;s going to be a hell of a story .
there was amazing improvements .
what we need down@@ stream is a great power enabled -- what i call that sy@@ s ad@@ min force .
in some cases this will involve a dele@@ gation of responsibility , a dele@@ gation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administra@@ tive responsibilities .
you know , co@@ yo@@ te in central park , a whale in the go@@ wan@@ us canal , el@@ k in west@@ chester county .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m her uncle , she &apos;s fine , you can leave now . &quot;
they are what we just said -- facial features , hair structure , skin color .
you &apos;d have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back@@ -up .
they &apos;re essentially digital cameras .
but before i do , i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the su@@ v of the sand , the ship of the desert . it &apos;s so vital to the inhabit@@ ants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely mon@@ goli@@ a and sahara -- that there are 160 words in arabic to describe the camel .
and in the novel , a particular one named al@@ vin is created . and he says , maybe this isn &apos;t the best way , and wre@@ cks the whole system .
there &apos;s been an experiment for the last four or five years on the geor@@ ges bank , or the grand banks off of new@@ found@@ land . it &apos;s a no-@@ take fishing zone .
when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they &apos;re gonna ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives , some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet , to go extinct because we weren &apos;t able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
sher@@ yl wu@@ dun@@ n : our century &apos;s greatest injustice
i also talk about the metro@@ card ven@@ ding machine , which i consider a master@@ piece of interaction .
so the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around .
so you feel this massive heat , and you go , &quot; i want to get out of the way . &quot;
he said , &quot; your shoulder &apos;s going to be fine , but dave , there &apos;s something in your lung . &quot;
but jefferson wasn &apos;t quite right , was he ?
in 1993 , there was a table at the conference in seattle , and a guy called marc andre@@ essen was demonstr@@ ating his little browser for the world wide web .
or even , as we get very much older , driving our cars to go visit people .
well , people power has been there for a while .
&quot; hello ? uh , hey . &quot;
that &apos;s what it was . and why were we attached to that ?
wait . wait .
but in the last few minutes , i just want to give you a different perspective of what i think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology .
and many , many things at google have come out of that , such as or@@ ku@@ t and also google news .
the difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family .
thank you . thank you .
together they com@@ prise practical wisdom , which aristotle thought was the master virtue .
sm : so what &apos;s happening here ?
augu@@ stine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defe@@ ct in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
the second wave was the mu@@ tated , super-@@ killer wave .
it &apos;s built with mostly off-@@ the-@@ shelf parts and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the ro@@ vs james cameron used to explore the titanic .
we did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the nih for millions of dollars failed for fu@@ tili@@ ty last week , and announced it .
so , we tried it .
there are re@@ posit@@ ories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vi@@ als of flies of different mu@@ tants and screen them in your as@@ say and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation .
we &apos;ve got some pretty amazing neurolog@@ y and other people . &quot;
and so he looked at it , and he said , &quot; thank you . i &apos;ll look at it perio@@ di@@ cally . &quot;
this is another african girl &apos;s wish .
still juggling .
&quot; work is against human nature . the proof is that it makes us tired . &quot;
and i study that in the natural world , the inter@@ connectedness of species .
we say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison .
and when all this became clear to me , i realized the only obvious thing to do is build a ven@@ ding machine .
it was founded in the eigh@@ te@@ ent@@ h century , the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of connecticut , other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time .
umar is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern nigeria .
&quot; ok , open your eyes . &quot;
but of course , that &apos;s not all you do -- there &apos;s 15 pies .
thank you .
and then he said to himself , &quot; i don &apos;t want to die .
anyone want to run a compar@@ ative effec@@ tiveness study on prayer against something ? let &apos;s look at prayer .
okay . so , now you &apos;re ready for the good news that i said might save the world .
so , i want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials -- but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end , because we don &apos;t have the whole time to plan .
carolyn por@@ co : this is saturn
now this is a very complicated struggle .
people &apos;s attention span after 18 minutes begins to drop off , tests have shown .
ann cooper : what &apos;s wrong with school lun@@ ches
this is where it really hit home for me -- that my legs could be we@@ arable sculpture .
and let me show you something else .
this is pan@@ chro@@ matic . it &apos;s actually four color con@@ es .
so you have to adapt .
and he was great . he just gave her a big hug in return , and it worked out great .
so look at the average here -- this is the average for all of sub-saharan africa .
i was going to have to change .
and when you turn off the gate , there &apos;s no current flowing through the device .
and i would also add , it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people , the whole world working for it .
so the culture , the northern ab@@ original culture , traditionally has been highly seas@@ onal .
now , most people here would automatically say no . ok , but i want you to realize some facts .
and the male ... we &apos;re going to see it again .
weeks from the charter for compassion launch , karen armstrong looks at religion &apos;s role in the 21st century : will its dog@@ mas divide us ? or will it unite us for common good ? she reviews the cataly@@ sts that can drive the world &apos;s fai@@ ths to rediscover the golden rule .
home is a transi@@ ent concept .
and i &apos;m like , knock dis@@ comfort upside the head and move it over and get all a &apos;s .
we had them engineered by the engineers .
but those environments are going to be widely spac@@ ed in this universe .
nobel peace prize winner ley@@ mah g@@ bo@@ we@@ e has two powerful stories to tell -- of her own life &apos;s transformation , and of the un@@ tapped potential of girls around the world . can we transform the world by un@@ locking the great@@ ness of girls ?
they &apos;ll be able to focus their hearing , they &apos;ll be able to increase the sensitivity , decrease the sensitivity , do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
and a little bit higher , why they have a gla@@ ze on a thing they call a th@@ ali .
these people know their sense of purpose , and they activate in their life , that &apos;s worth about seven years of extra life expectancy .
bf : up and over his shoulders .
it &apos;s not the only reason preventing heart disease .
and i was particularly interested because i wanted to see one of these cables being built . see , you know , all the time online we experience these fle@@ eting moments of connection , these sort of brief adjac@@ encies , a tweet or a facebook post or an email , and it seemed like there was a physical cor@@ oll@@ ary to that .
you can see his mental work@@ load spike as he goes through this , as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity .
the first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today , both because of the inputs , which are becoming massive , and because of the plasti@@ city of the organ , is the brain .
well this view , i think , is increasingly wrong .
i want to end with a story . and then , just a comment .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s an amazing way , and i &apos;ll tell you , if you come home , and your spouse , or whoever it is , says , &quot; let &apos;s talk &quot; -- that , like , chil@@ ls you to the very core .
so maybe we need a narrative for acknowled@@ ging the end , and for saying goodbye , and maybe our new story will be about a hero &apos;s fight , and a hero &apos;s goodbye .
let &apos;s take , for example , sweden .
why couldn &apos;t we just inject the pan@@ cre@@ as with something to regenerate the pan@@ cre@@ as early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was symp@@ to@@ matic ?
he was brought in in october 2007 as the new super@@ inten@@ dent to basically fix this broken school system .
so what you &apos;re getting is the capability now of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene .
ok , this is the route up everest .
there they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the re@@ discovery of wonder .
you throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet .
because i feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clothes out there .
what lies ahead ?
we &apos;re not trying to tell them who they ought to be .
i &apos;m interested in what i like to call the &quot; triple bottom line &quot; that sustainable development can produce .
rb : many times .
this is the only part that &apos;s battery backed up .
and i think the best way to achieve that , and get a feeling for any fla@@ ws in your design , is to act it out .
and my kids , trained and certified -- ma , you get the tax ab@@ at@@ ement . thank you , mayor blo@@ om@@ berg -- can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that , and that to me , people , is another true &quot; s@@ í se pu@@ e@@ de &quot; moment .
and one of the other things i &apos;d been interested in and obsessed with over the years is sp@@ ines and skeletons , having collected a couple of hundred .
odysseus would have said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s do a dry run .
so how can they address this remaining water footprint ?
i &apos;d like to share with you how that happened , and also describe my experience of being psychotic .
now , i &apos;m by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is .
this is natasha &apos;s wedding day .
pre-@@ sweat the details for your audience . count the ta@@ ps .
so i decided to go there and act as a seller .
except maybe french people .
because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel , often sometimes seven to 15 kilometers , sometimes by foot , to get a simple health check done , is very , very de@@ tri@@ mental in the sense that it really dis@@ su@@ ades people from getting access to health care .
and in fact , i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things .
i said , &quot; let &apos;s get married . &quot;
no values , just facts about all the world &apos;s religions .
don &apos;t be surprised if you feel a bit ag@@ it@@ ated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that .
even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who &apos;s being sni@@ ped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endanger@@ ing your life , helping people get into tax@@ is who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
you know , just jump .
so , to conclude , intelligent power can , globally , save thousands of lives , prevent tens of thousands of injuries , and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year , while significantly reducing global energy consumption .
b.@@ j. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future .
trying to figure that stuff out . but is it going to get you anywhere ?
32 million heart attacks and strokes occur .
ah , some of you have . excellent .
so like johnny dep@@ p , and like 25 percent of americans between the ages of 16 and 50 , i have a tattoo .
and i just love to see the world . the world is an amazing place .
they are also able to play -- they are really playing .
and up until a little more than a century ago , nobody was able to do that with the brain .
but you see , when you &apos;re using a computer , you can just substitute .
sometimes they hunt -- not that often , but when they hunt , they show sophisticated cooperation , and they share the prey .
my characters drove cars .
and , again , it &apos;s because of an alig@@ nment of the incentives .
what is the wall mostly made of ? atoms .
and he &apos;s like , &quot; i don &apos;t believe it either .
well the answer is the science of radio astronomy .
its position , of course , in the middle of manhattan -- it &apos;s on hunter &apos;s point .
here &apos;s a re@@ viewer online , on amazon .
for the kidney , as i talked to you about the first painting that you saw , the first slide i showed you , 90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney , 90 percent .
to those to whom it doesn &apos;t happen , there will be ad@@ versi@@ ties .
i use rock@@ si@@ m to simulate flights before they go to see if they &apos;ll break su@@ person@@ ic or not , and then fly them with on-@@ board computers to veri@@ fy their performance .
and this is a perspective .
that first one is human@@ s-@@ ver@@ sus@@ -@@ nature ; we &apos;ve won , there &apos;s no more gain . human population .
perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gy@@ re , where these materials are being mechan@@ ically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they &apos;re not really going away .
and the population will double in one generation .
rb : dropping in for tea .
so he &apos;s calling oxytocin &quot; the moral molecule . &quot;
us@@ man ri@@ a@@ z : yes , that was the first one . and then i -- that was the first thing i learned , and then i started progr@@ essing to other things .
the lessons for us are three-@@ fold .
it is our light , and not our darkness , that fri@@ gh@@ tens us . &quot;
often they travel on pre-@@ published rou@@ tes .
we actually write it only to set our attitudes right .
the reason is that the system gets rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed for the kids they sp@@ it out the other end , not the children who read .
you stand up , and you sk@@ im the stone .
so , it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain .
resources that were transferred to them -- and were the spanish ashamed of this ? no !
and frankly , although i keep getting asked this , it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances .
and it was a prototype . and a month and a half later , i come back to switzerland , and there he is playing with his own version .
ok , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
i was very excited . i walked with him to his office .
good luck having a conversation with them .
so that &apos;s what i normally do .
so there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
well you might have , but i don &apos;t think so .
let me give you some examples .
and this year i composed a romantic style .
mo : we need to tell people what not to bring .
but what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets ?
i mean , companies are all about finding the right people , inspiring those people , you know , drawing out the best in people .
and i close with this image of democracy in action : this is a protest that &apos;s happening on a retro@@ fit in silver spring , maryland on an astro@@ tur@@ f town green .
now like with anything that &apos;s really different from the status quo , it didn &apos;t always go so well testing that aircraft .
and she said , &quot; he says he knows who you are , what do you want ? &quot;
e@@ o : thank you .
you just had teams of hundreds of people .
i &apos;ve seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and un@@ cles .
so when i said that , they said , &quot; well show us what is possible . what are you doing ?
well , what happened over the last 25 years ?
so , social networks are these intricate things of beauty , and they &apos;re so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous , in fact , that one has to ask what purpose they serve .
it used to be that you were a guy who went to high school but you had a specific set of skills , and with the help of a union , you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life .
i guarantee if you come to your lab at 3 - 4 am we have students working there , not because i tell them to , but because we are having too much fun .
they &apos;re killing so many people they can &apos;t even afford to bury them all in anything but these un@@ marked gra@@ ves like this one outside of ci@@ u@@ dad ju@@ arez .
and when i say manipulated , i &apos;m talking about in a darwinian sense , right ?
and he expressed his uns@@ ha@@ ke@@ able convi@@ ctions in everyday language , in metaphors , in stories .
and this is even better . this is au@@ ger-@@ lo@@ i@@ ze@@ au , &quot; after@@ life . &quot;
but well done , him .
and who &apos;s responsible ? designers .
and that actually helped a lot .
and i &apos;ll take her advice on that .
when i first moved to hollywood from silicon valley , i had some mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings .
i love the brooklyn dod@@ gers , as you do , but i promise you some day they will win fairly and squ@@ ar@@ ely .
now it &apos;s all done on my iphone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the back@@ end work and categ@@ ori@@ zes things and puts everything together .
communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
of those 85 takes , only three actually successfully completed their run .
and chicken soon joined them on the thr@@ one .
and the her@@ b@@ als , the bot@@ an@@ ical books of up to the late middle ages , the renaissance are filled with prescri@@ ptions for causing convul@@ sions to shake the evil spirits out .
and the first place we &apos;ve done that is in southern siberia in the al@@ ta@@ i mountains at a place called deniso@@ va , a cave site in this mountain here , where ar@@ che@@ ologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone -- this is a copy of it -- that they realized came from the last p@@ hal@@ an@@ x of a little finger of a pin@@ ky of a human .
here &apos;s the cru@@ x of the obstacle .
now this is not to say afghanistan is a place full of people like mul@@ la@@ h mu@@ staf@@ a .
so i y@@ elled , &quot; who the hell &apos;s out there ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
now it had a sense of place .
here &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ by-@@ step that shows grin@@ ding hamburger .
this small group of women , determined to bring an end to the war , and they chose to use their traditions to make a point : li@@ beri@@ an women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing .
people who say , don &apos;t sit that team next to this team , because they like noise and they need quiet .
in less than 40 years , there will be 9 billion of us .
they really wanted to be able to welcome hyun-sook into their family .
we only knew about the return of the jews and the decre@@ e of cyrus from the he@@ brew scrip@@ tures .
ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es , the ancient greek play@@ wright , he described the clouds as the pat@@ ron go@@ des@@ ses of id@@ le fellows two and a half thousand years ago , and you can see what he means .
it was short-@@ lived .
this guy &apos;s 60 years old .
and the last day , the sun comes out , the or@@ cas come , they &apos;re right by the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
this is not about proje@@ cting power , but about staying power , which is about legiti@@ macy with the lo@@ cals .
we &apos;ve moved towards large-scale and very high control .
because when these people get home after a screening of &quot; re@@ ar window &quot; and raise their gaze to the building next door , they have the tools to wonder who , apart from them , is out there and what is their story .
we do not create revolutions .
it &apos;s as old as breathing .
but instead , we stick a camera in the deep ocean , and we see a fish , and it doesn &apos;t capture our imagination as a society .
where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence , the most horrific poverty , genocide , mass ra@@ pes , the destruction of the earth , is completely out of control .
getting it wrong , and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its share@@ holders but nothing improves for the people with bru@@ ised sh@@ ins .
instead , i &apos;d like to try something called &quot; improvisation . &quot;
the patient &apos;s cut open , twice .
we have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies .
the good news , again , is that a lot of the things they need we already have , and we are very good at giving : economic assistance , not just money , but expertise , technology , kno@@ who@@ w , private investment , fair terms of trade , medicine , education , technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective , for their anti-@@ terror forces to become more efficient .
and then we went home . we &apos;d sort of done it .
but i did notice something happening to me the day i was with al dun@@ lap .
the torture was good . wasn &apos;t it good torture ?
the cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well .
and that is where the research began .
but the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much .
i don &apos;t think it looks like us .
and this isn &apos;t something that you can quantify or track or measure , and we tend to under@@ value things in society that we can &apos;t measure .
by 1960 we had telephone bills , bank statements were being produced by computers .

they &apos;re fighting battles over much nar@@ ro@@ wer issues .
they take this san@@ ctu@@ ary in time very serious .
we pil@@ ed enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
it &apos;s good to start with some examples .
carbon dioxide , a little bit of sunlight , you end up with a li@@ pid that is highly refined .
he was interviewed once , and he said the following .
it depended on the shape of their skull , though , so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had re@@ constructed and could prove to the scientific world that super@@ cro@@ c in fact is a 40-@@ foot crocodile , probably a male .
but it would never have occurred to me to think that just because i had read a novel in which a character was a seri@@ al killer that he was somehow representative of all americans .

and it was quite fascinating , because you know the guy -- his name was joey gri@@ mal@@ di -- he im@@ person@@ ated the moor@@ ish general -- you know , for the first three minutes he was really that general , and then he went back into plum@@ ber , he worked as a plum@@ ber , so -- plum@@ ber , general , plum@@ ber , general -- so for three dollars , i saw two trage@@ dies for the price of one .
five , six , seven , eight folds we make .
so i also have in the game a sab@@ ot@@ eur -- some child -- it &apos;s basically a trou@@ ble@@ maker -- and i have my trou@@ ble@@ maker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
no matter , she was just delighted to be in school .
they want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidi@@ zed electric power .
for example , mobile human@@ oid robots are still incredibly primitive , but the research arm of the defense department just launched a competition to have them do things like this , and if the track record is any guide , this competition is going to be successful .
earlier that week , i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring ski@@ ing -- yes , i fell .
she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
if you &apos;re an un@@ infected man living in botswana , where the hiv rate is 30 percent , if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner , girlfriend , mi@@ stress -- your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points .
so when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end , it puts some heat into the spon@@ ge .
and for that i do not need an electric grid between us .
we all have foxo genes , but we don &apos;t all have exactly the same form of the foxo gene .
dam@@ ien runs a hotel outside of kin@@ sh@@ as@@ a .
so , we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points , integrated across everything we know about the patient .
they &apos;re going to be small .
it &apos;s not even clear that our very close genetic relatives , the neanderthals , had social learning .
it &apos;s a working prototype . i will use it for all the jumps .
and when we do and it swi@@ ms , we see this magnificent bath@@ y@@ me@@ try that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii .
the first country we went to work in , the bahamas , was paying 3,@@ 500 dollars for these drugs .
and we &apos;re going to cruise down and take a look at bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water coming from the north , and in the seas rising from the south .
so many people in the medical world don &apos;t want to change , particularly not when some jum@@ pe@@ d-up engineer has come along with the answer .
in 1995 , we started working on a two-@@ year investiga@@ tive research project to try and find out what was going on .
sha@@ pe-@@ re@@ taining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum fo@@ il , and it holds its place . contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always boun@@ ces back .
i sometimes see when i &apos;m speaking to a con@@ gre@@ gation of religious people a sort of mu@@ tin@@ ous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead .
so , i think it &apos;s as low-cost as we &apos;re likely to be able to come up and make things .
on the fifth of december 1985 , a bottle of 17@@ 87 la@@ fit@@ te was sold for 10@@ 5,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record .
well , mark t@@ wa@@ in certainly thought so .
there is no border in between .
why does what &apos;s happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you ?
they &apos;re feedback loops .
the answer was absolutely yes .
have you found wikipedia being used by teachers , and how do you see wikipedia changing education ?
now i cli@@ cked on this on purpose , but if i &apos;d somehow gotten here by mistake , it does remind me , for the band , see &quot; the beatles , &quot; for the car see &quot; volk@@ swa@@ gon beetle , &quot; but i am here for beetle beetles .
you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes .
and basically what you &apos;ll see is what economists talk about as the polari@@ zation of the economy .
so i &apos;m going to tell you three things about this today .
and he said that every day this six-year-old , dressed in her beautiful dress , would walk with real grace through a p@@ hal@@ an@@ x of white people screaming angri@@ ly , calling her a monster , threatening to poison her -- distorted faces .
now , while the smell wa@@ fts over you , let me tell you the history of an idea .
and i initially ended up in the business section of the book@@ store looking for a business solution .
it must have occurred to ca@@ stro that he has the chance to do for cuba what den@@ g xi@@ a@@ oping did for china , but he doesn &apos;t have a hong kong there on the island in cuba .
and he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room .
do@@ o@@ sh ! again , the image re@@ creates itself .
and when i met har@@ rie@@ t in person the next year at the ted conference , she &apos;d gone online and ordered our own happy ha@@ plot@@ ype t-shirts .
you get up , it flus@@ hes by itself .
they just have to get their work done .
and maybe somebody &apos;s never said that to you , but you &apos;ve done a really , really good job .
see if you can see those waves propag@@ ating through the swarm .
i like to show this shot -- this is u@@ bald tam@@ ou@@ fe , who &apos;s the lead investi@@ gator in our camer@@ oon site .
because of the oil , everybody talked about the poll@@ lu@@ tion .
the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much .
so everybody must be able to say , &quot; this happened to me , and it did this with me , but i &apos;m able to live with it , to cope with it , and to learn from it .
this is the he@@ w@@ lett@@ -@@ pack@@ ard garage .
we are god now . we are . it &apos;s almost done .
we &apos;ve done this for a very difficult case , which was for deforestation in china .
there &apos;s no comparison at all .
we can use thi@@ cker , younger , better tissues than you might have injured in your knee , or that you might have when you &apos;re 40 , 50 or 60 .

growing up is about a@@ iming to succeed wil@@ dly and being fulfilled by failing really well .
so we find this penny kind of fossili@@ zed in the floor , and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don &apos;t just lose money .
this technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way with maybe a speaker system . &quot;
and the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that doesn &apos;t really work .
they &apos;ve been around a long time , have been very important to coast communities .
it occurred throughout the central nervous system , including in the brain stem , where we observed up to 30@@ 0-@@ percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain .
and you &apos;ll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top , and a bright orange tile at the side .
this increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture -- the cru@@ ci@@ ble that holds science and technology and wide-@@ scale changes in behavior that improve health and well-being .
with these words , thank you very much .
and then , four@@ thly : i want to mention the sa@@ pling foundation , which is the new owner of ted .
and no guy ever gets critici@@ zed . but that &apos;s the least of it .
and it &apos;s been used since the &apos; 90s to study really complex processes .
there is some good news . first of all , let me say , we &apos;ve come a long , long way .
the web doesn &apos;t know that that is actually a town , and that it &apos;s a specific town that i live in , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be talking about .
now let me give you an example from my act .
i &apos;ve got no body@@ guards , i &apos;ve got no police cars . i &apos;ve got nothing .
they have to sub@@ ver@@ t tradition that once sil@@ enced them in order to give voice to new aspirations .
well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
people who have no light , whether it &apos;s physical or metaphorical , cannot pass our exam@@ s , and we can never know what they know .

this boy here in the middle of central india -- this is in a ra@@ jas@@ than village , where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process , they &apos;ve enjoyed themselves thor@@ ough@@ ly .
this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once -- captured on film .
and i think just the opposite is true .
it was only then that i realized it was simply a gate that i was coming into .
it &apos;s a satellite which was all made of ice , and we measured it from orbit . made of ice .
so when we found the cancer , it doesn &apos;t seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other , we believed that , if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough , and we worked hard enough , we could keep him from dying ever .
and it might make you think , perhaps there &apos;s an issue to do with areas , and in this talk , i &apos;d like to talk about land areas , and ask , is there an issue about areas ? the answer is going to be yes but it depends which country you are in .
this one &apos;s not . it &apos;s invaded you .
i was 17 .
back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
and he &apos;s going to do that on the day of judgment with angels and trum@@ pets , and the skies will open .
but i had three days of life support , and everybody was expecting , due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that i wasn &apos;t going to make it , so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or po@@ op , and — — when i finally po@@ oped , then that somehow , sur@@ gically speaking , that &apos;s like you crossed some good line , and , um — — on that day , the surgeon came in and whi@@ pped the sheet off of me .
we can talk to them . we can get a solution . the opposite happened .
so there &apos;s an interesting discussion going on there .
and as a kid i grew up very close to here , and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the rail@@ way waiting for the great big express trains to ro@@ ar past .
the one on the left walks away because she knows already .
this is the ster@@ i@@ olith@@ ography of a staircase .
and to tell you a bit about the things that i make , the easiest place to start the story is with a hat .
there &apos;s something called bold imaging , which is blood oxygen level dependent imaging .
well , this is a little 15-@@ month-@@ old little girl , and she has autism .
poor nutrition , access to water , climate change , deforestation , lack of skills , inse@@ curity , not enough food , not enough healthcare , pollution .
i didn &apos;t know about the environment then .
i &apos;d been working through my lot after all .
it &apos;s cooling off .
the government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out , which we all know is impossible , and then to mi@@ ti@@ gate the impact primarily on our economy .
unfortunately in the united states , we are not covering but washington d.c. at this moment in time for al jazeera english .
and he says , you know , &quot; philosophers love rational argument . &quot;
you place the muscle cells on the outside .
fast food has taken over the whole country ; we know that .
he su@@ mmed it up , really , at a dinner .
so i don &apos;t like the way that they take the power away from you .
1983 was when we won the world cup .
people are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to dis@@ close their condition , none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws pur@@ port to protect .
the other one that i want to suggest , the caution that all of us have to have , i constantly have to remind myself , about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true , that we believe in ?
this man , for example , mul@@ la@@ h mu@@ staf@@ a , tried to shoot me .
it &apos;s one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he &apos;s leading to realize whatever he &apos;s dreaming .
will it happen again ?
and in the center of kun@@ ene region is the village of ses@@ f@@ ont@@ ein . this is where i was born .
but you get up at 4 a.@@ m .
in 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
we also try to study our fo@@ e .
and lu@@ ria said , &quot; but what do my words imp@@ ly ? &quot;
they are not as good at bri@@ bing as many of their international competitors are , but they were not allowed to show their strengths , because the world was eaten up by grand corruption .
check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program .
tum@@ ble@@ weed rolls through the meeting room .
on one side financial , on the other side social .
this is the bar that he set for us .
i just couldn &apos;t wait to get to that classroom every day .
the three of us go to the exam together , and we sit down .
but then some of us gener@@ alized it further . and then it did !
we basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible .
and that also challenges the paradig@@ ms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people .
now , i remember when i was about 15 , i read a copy of life magazine , which detailed a story about a 7@@ 5@@ -year-old blind russian woman who could sense printed letters -- there &apos;s still people trying to do it here -- -- who could sense printed letters and even sense colors , just by touch .
i wanted to show you the ways , inno@@ cu@@ ous as they seem , in which we &apos;re incorpor@@ ating what we &apos;ve learned about girls -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility , and to play around with the social complexity of their lives .
so the average manhat@@ tan@@ ite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn &apos;t seen since the &apos; 20s , consuming half of the electricity of dallas .
that is my job for the next two years , to design an entire master plan , and then for the next 10 years to implement it -- of course , with so many other people .
they mess@@ ed up and left just a stick of wire in there .
its sensor be@@ ams look both forward and backward at the same time , allowing it to do new exploration while it &apos;s still achieving geomet@@ ric sensor@@ -@@ lock on what it &apos;s gone through already .
now , for decades there has been a can@@ on@@ ical solution to this problem , which is to use something called and a version control system does what is says on the tin .
i feel kind of bad about that .
but in the meantime i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the satur@@ nine system , and visit the enceladus inter@@ planetary ge@@ y@@ ser park , just because we can .
so in 2005 , the campaign got more momentum , was more successful in australia and then new zealand , and then in 2006 we came to a pi@@ vot@@ al point .
it &apos;s being poured into our eyes through the web , and we &apos;re all visu@@ ali@@ zers now ; we &apos;re all demanding a visual aspect to our information .
and then it &apos;s my box .
and you don &apos;t need the three billion-@@ dollar hadron collider for doing this .
it &apos;s been 110 years since geor@@ ges m@@ é@@ li@@ è@@ s sent a spaceship slam@@ ming into the eye of the man on the moon . so how far have visual effects come since then ? working closely with the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , don le@@ vy takes us on a visual journey through special effects , from the fa@@ ker@@ y of early technology to the seam@@ less mar@@ vels of modern film@@ making .
like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all .
this seems puzz@@ ling . but i &apos;m going to argue that you shouldn &apos;t be surprised by this , and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does -- as an investment .
therefore we &apos;re to rethink the whole way we look at health .
ay@@ dah al ja@@ hn@@ ani also took risks and put herself out , to compete in the poet of the millions competition .
yeah , good .
thank you .
there &apos;s some sand that &apos;s really much more colorful .
and my question on the other side is just going to be , &quot; what do you think they value ? &quot;
&quot; something &apos;s wrong with the air condi@@ tion@@ er -- smell of burning v-@@ belts in the air . &quot;
that tells us we were all still living in africa at that time .
i mean , can you have rules about creativity ?
in moments of war there &apos;s great technological innovation , and in the world you have to do without -- well , during the second world war , you had to do without steel , you had to do without aluminum .
just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
he is my psycho@@ analyst . he is my teacher .
so taboo number four : you can &apos;t say that your average happiness has declined since having a child .
plenty of people need jobs with very flexible hours -- but it &apos;s difficult for those people to connect with the emplo@@ yers who need them . wing@@ ham ro@@ wan is working on that . he explains how the same technology that powers modern financial markets can help emplo@@ yers book workers for sli@@ vers of time .
but as we learned from sam@@ anth@@ a power , in her story about sergio vi@@ ei@@ ra de mell@@ o , you can &apos;t just go charging in , saying , &quot; you &apos;re wrong , and i &apos;m right . &quot;
so we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation .
just trying to play the odds . all right , here we go .
do you have any children ? were your children vaccin@@ ated ? &quot;
but what really causes an effect is you tell people , &quot; look , you could res@@ ell it , you could bo@@ ast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s thor@@ ough@@ ly washed . &quot;
and this is the other one -- that you just take a straw , and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-@@ cuts .
one : provide care to children who are currently being depri@@ ved of treatment .
gb : well , of course national identity remains important .
imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin .
behind the scenes is a working lab at stanford university partner@@ ed with the monterey bay aquarium .
you would think this wouldn &apos;t be too hard , that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we &apos;re learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease and build a bridge across this y@@ aw@@ ning gap between what we &apos;ve learned about basic science and its application , a bridge that would look maybe something like this , where you &apos;d have to put together a nice sh@@ iny way to get from one side to the other .
so there &apos;s a basic line for people . and also , it can be changed .
and that rarely , if ever , caused anything like the scientific revolution .
and the question was , will ugly jerry and ugly tom help their respe@@ ctive , more attractive brothers ?
this is a map of social networks worldwide , and certainly facebook has conqu@@ ered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing , depending on how you like the way facebook manages its service .
it &apos;s not just a whole lot of other plants .
i &apos;m my father &apos;s daughter . i read , i write , i think about global health a lot .
and if you do not let us continue with our work , i will hold a press conference here , right now , right in this road , and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censor@@ s of the soci@@ alist re@@ alism era . &quot;
even a business school professor has thought about it that way .
this floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor .
we see abo@@ ve-@@ ground mines .
js : so that &apos;s importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here , remix isn &apos;t just about an individual doing something alone in his basement ; it becomes an act of social creativity .
but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint , we should feel a bit of fear .
ph : you know , that one computer was huge .
okay , there &apos;s a few heart@@ breaks that chocolate can &apos;t fix .
but , he agreed to do it , even though daniel co@@ hn@@ -@@ ben@@ dit &apos;s life was not in danger , just because it was a good opportunity to mo@@ ck the authorities , and to show them that there &apos;s nothing more por@@ ous than borders -- and that ideas have no borders .
we &apos;re so used to thinking in terms of biology , we think about genes this way .
we &apos;ll actually part the water to pull money out of the air , because it &apos;s a bright future if you &apos;re an algorithm .
but if i think about it , i thought i wanted a husband , but what i really wanted was a family that was loving . and i fier@@ c@@ ely love my children , and they love me back . &quot;
we couldn &apos;t veri@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
gor@@ e-@@ tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees , to the point where they really kind of shu@@ n the idea of bos@@ ses .
so i scra@@ ped the slime off and i sent it off to aber@@ deen .
that &apos;s a very powerful idea , and it &apos;s a very powerful reality .
now luckily , oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood , so i could do this experiment without learning neuro@@ surgery .
now what do all of these things have in common ?
we heard about that yesterday .
right . there &apos;s a person at newcastle who has figured out that it &apos;s a very large neuron .
now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file -- well there &apos;s the image hea@@ der , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
so dy@@ st@@ onia is a disorder affecting children .
she was just released a couple of weeks ago , and we &apos;re very concerned to see how long she will be free , because she is already out in the streets in ran@@ go@@ on , ag@@ it@@ ating for change .
in fact , a year earlier , a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed .
and what we really want to do -- well , the architects , if there are architects out there , this is the lau@@ gier hut ; this is the primitive hut that &apos;s been around for so long -- and what we wanted to do is really build this , because they see themselves as the care@@ ta@@ kers of the world , and we wanted them to look down at their satellite , how they see their own site , that eight-@@ acre site , and we wanted nothing left . we wanted it to stay green .
well if you &apos;re rec@@ lined a great deal , you have to use muscle force to hold your head there .
it really is just a new idea .
and that dna ap@@ tam@@ er will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it .
and i looked at her , i remember that day , and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angel@@ ine .
a lot of people are working on things to try and reduce that , but i didn &apos;t have anything to contribute in that area .
during the die-@@ off of the gh@@ arial we did gal@@ vani@@ ze a lot of action .
you can &apos;t expect that . &quot;
and then , once it was in the right place , he got back in the water holding a big knife , and he cut each bu@@ oy off , and the bu@@ oy popped up into the air , and the cable dropped to the sea floor , and he did that all the way out to the ship , and when he got there , they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie , and then he jumped back in , and he swa@@ m back to shore , and then he lit a cigarette .
and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
and it was so successful that they made it into a movie .
this is information that is incredibly powerful .
it is this mer@@ ging of our self with divin@@ ity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions .
because step three never ends .
and i would like to run it for them .
they actually used 6@@ j@@ 6 , the common radio tube , because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes .
and basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
play by yourself then .
and i think that the answer is , we can look at mortality data , and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past .
so let me just give you a summary of what no-@@ take reserves do .
the central nervous system nerves , there is no cure .
so to explain that -- if you &apos;ve got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it , then the phot@@ on of light has momentum , which kno@@ cks the particle , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it .
paul fis@@ h@@ stein who began working there in 1978 -- worked for save the children , ran the afghan research and evalu@@ ation unit .
j so these are -- as far as we can tell -- classical whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
and by the way , when i asked him about his own likelihood of divorce , he said he was quite sure it was zero percent .
we would then take that re@@ generation temp@@ late and ins@@ ert it into the missing men@@ is@@ cus car@@ ti@@ lage to re@@ grow that in a patient &apos;s knee .
but now the question is : how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper ?
but over four generations , he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a ta@@ sting menu .
so , another way to think about technology , what it means , is to imagine a world without technology .
the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own video@@ dis@@ c as well as build your own hyper@@ card stacks .
does this have cumu@@ lative effects ?
zo@@ e : five . lg : yeah -- i will reverse it face up here .
what makes the building expensive , in the traditional sense , is making individual parts custom , that you can &apos;t do over and over again .
so , 125 degrees is normal .
but in fact , that &apos;s not what women lined up to tell me .
robbie mi@@ zz@@ one : thank you .
a large fraction of those people are in the united states .
we need to fix it , so that we can deliver it to our patients .
and the thing that i realized is there was no way that i , as an engineer , could write this book that would get all of this across .
it &apos;s rather like that line in the film &quot; as good as it gets . &quot;
everything is affected . and we have to organize our response appropriately . we need a worldwide , global mobili@@ zation for renewable energy , conservation , efficiency and a global transition to a low-@@ carbon economy .
i woke up in intensive care , and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage i had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes , and i thought , &quot; great , because i &apos;m going to the olympics ! &quot;
and then i remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me , &quot; what do you want to be ? what do you want to be ?
and let me show you what &apos;s behind it .
that lawyers who represent death row inmates have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters of the death penalty story .
you don &apos;t need to believe me . you shouldn &apos;t believe me .
and the journalist said , why is there so little response out of washington ?
ber@@ nie ma@@ do@@ ff stole 65 billion dollars .
when you go into beauty the probability wave collap@@ ses into one possibility .
there is a point in this video , towards the beginning where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring , as if to say , &quot; it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s just his job . he really does like women . &quot;
and he did a painting of this experience , which he called &quot; in the realm of music . &quot;
i thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer .
so , this represents -- this is a cross-@@ sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world &apos;s greatest photo@@ journalists , working at the very top of their craft -- except one .
the bottom of the pyramid is benef@@ iting hugely from technology .
brand usa could use some poli@@ shing .
and i just finished a couple of months ago .
it &apos;s not a lot of money at the global level .
as with any large investment , it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn &apos;t working out .
that means we can do it again .
we have the first generation of children in america who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents .
i found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-@@ word phr@@ ases that appear more often in the most favorite tedtalks as opposed to the least favorite tedtalks .
it &apos;s an aerial region@@ al-@@ scale environmental surve@@ yor .
today . this is the first time you &apos;re talking about it .
if you were not able to take the sc@@ ore@@ board out of the arena and be able to do the ice ca@@ pa@@ des the next night , that would also be bad .
every patient we do has an absolutely bes@@ poke implant .

rob hopkins reminds us that the oil our world depends on is ste@@ adily running out . he pro@@ poses a unique solution to this problem -- the transition response , where we prepare ourselves for life without oil and sacrifice our lux@@ u@@ ries to build systems and communities that are completely independent of fossil fuels .
his was a lonely struggle , because bihar was also india &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enrich@@ ing themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their angu@@ ish if their children had no food or no schooling .
so this is a small crank generator .
he co@@ ached little league for our son .
on one hand , we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the fron@@ tiers of technology , as this conference vivi@@ dly demonstrates .
how did we achieve that ?
i &apos;m going , &quot; my gosh ! &quot; i had never seen anything like this in my life !
something is very challenging to me .
you can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave .
and it has not been the case for most of modern american history .
a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party , which are cities .
it was two persons saying , &quot; let &apos;s do this , &quot; and the company said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and by profession , he &apos;s a psychop@@ hysi@@ cist .
for others it &apos;s not the past , it &apos;s not the present , it &apos;s only about the future .
so already you can see there are contradi@@ ctions .
right now , every second , eight new users are joining the internet .
what it does is -- and this is what &apos;s happening in los altos -- it fre@@ es up time .
i mean , architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time . what we need to do now , develop things that can scale to those 300 million chinese people that would like to live in the city , and very comfort@@ ably .
he didn &apos;t go around telling people what needed to change in america .
i mean , schizophren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
okay , so everything around it is whole and intact .
and it was time for us to put oxygen in .
this is the opening frame of the video that we created .
and to certain extent it is , but i want to stress a couple of points .
and this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing captch@@ as on the internet .
well , the combined effect is as if i had just done the reflection in the line through z to start with .
well , we on cassini have taken an equivalent first , a picture that no human eye has ever seen before .
alberta sand oil , a lot of pollution .

today , they are saying four . but we don &apos;t have them . we &apos;ve got one .
try hitting the boat .
i picked this up at mit . it &apos;s a little younger .
what i learned from these people and others was that i couldn &apos;t judge them based on their failure to meet their very lo@@ fty goals .
maybe this isn &apos;t going to be quite so easy . &quot;
wish one : world-@@ changing . i want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability .
we need the best and the bri@@ ghtest from many different disciplines to come and join this effort -- all ages , all different groups -- because this is the time , folks .
the mcdonald &apos;s model scales .
thanks .
but i took them outside one day and i said , &quot; i want you to estimate the height of the building . &quot;
it &apos;s when we regenerate , when we rebuild ourselves , and with threatening noise like this going on , your body , even if you are able to sleep , your body is telling you , &quot; i &apos;m under threat . this is dangerous . &quot;
how does that depend on what people are doing ?
and if you zoom in 2@@ 70 times , you &apos;ll see it looks like a ru@@ g .
the w@@ ok shot caught fire three times .
and in part , that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great .
these targets have been achieved in india .
i &apos;m talking about teachers .
so they &apos;re restri@@ ctive -- don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the internet , don &apos;t be on i.@@ m .
and i had gone to take care of one particular patient , a woman who was dying of dementia .
we &apos;re now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation folks to scale this system up .
this leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change .
but i love that one , because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb .
and if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability .
this is what i understand from my faith tradition , and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions , and this is the common platform on which we must all stand , and when we stand on this platform as such , i am convinced that we can make a wonderful world .
when i got to the — for the next four , five years , i was held in four different children &apos;s homes .
and you can think of different forma@@ ts .
so all of these scores are made up of weather data .
this time it &apos;s not a cheese sandwich .
this was one of the groups .
but first , see what a miserable lot we are .
so she adapted .
at the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly , the happy extreme , are the new guinea farming societies where i &apos;ve been doing my fiel@@ d@@ work for the past 50 years , and most other se@@ dent@@ ary traditional societies around the world .
and i had to write down the name of this ted fellow so i didn &apos;t mess it up here .
the sun end was about four inches in diameter , and then it ta@@ per@@ ed over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the earth end .
this is what evolution tells us . and , it &apos;s true . it &apos;s kind of unbelievable .
you can get shot by the hard-@@ headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
there are no roads there , so they carry loads of stone on their backs , often of their own weight , up and down the himalaya mountains .
there are so many genuine threats in the world .
the possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing can help humanitarian organizations , not only ensure that people &apos;s right to information is met , or that they have their right to communicate , but i think in the future , humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard , that they &apos;re truly participating , that they &apos;re truly empowered in the humanitarian world .
then — will i keep going ?
&quot; do you understand what this guy wants ? &quot;
would it have been 10 centi@@ meters , or am i giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost ?
so what we &apos;ve been doing a couple of years -- but last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks so we could try to get some idea of sight fi@@ deli@@ ty and movements and things like that .

norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and ba@@ thro@@ oms , and this is not something to be considered high art . &quot;
now , i &apos;m also really big on photography .
she was scared of snakes . she was scared of rape .
and of course , if your leg stra@@ ps aren &apos;t set right , at that point you get another little thri@@ ll .
it &apos;s my response , my attitude , to op@@ pression that i &apos;ve got control over , and that i can do something about .
and i just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case .
i would love to build this one day , and perhaps i &apos;d like to build it also out of fl@@ our , sugar , polymer , wood chips -- i don &apos;t know , human hair . i don &apos;t know . i &apos;d love a go at that .
&#91; unclear &#93; they called me out here .
this is what you would need to steal or buy out of that 100-@@ metri@@ c-@@ ton stock@@ pile that &apos;s relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in hiroshima .
is that a concern ?
and so i &apos;ll take you to wi@@ chit@@ a , kansas , where i was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site , right downtown by the river .
i mean , it &apos;s cru@@ ci@@ fied .
and in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important , you have these kinds of signals here .
after three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , i decided to go to china to look for her myself .
kis@@ met : scientist : yeah , look , it &apos;s got a little blue light in it too .
for you , that might be surprising .

yes , because i just told you , we actually collect a lot of health data as economists .
we all have synes@@ thetic abilities .

it is a success story . it has been a success story .
well , he was the former oil minister of nigeria under president ab@@ ach@@ a , and it just so happens he &apos;s a convicted money la@@ under@@ er too .

not much has changed , by the way .
to my right is sheer shal@@ e . it &apos;s coming off .
now , the going gets tougher .
you &apos;ve all heard about things like stu@@ x@@ net .
because what you can measure in virtu@@ ality is everything .
i was more interested in the things in between , you know , because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there .
but in the case of a failed attempt to harm , where grace thought that it was poison , although it was really sugar , people now say it was more okay , she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee .
your brother , who &apos;s fallen in trouble , do you take care of him ?
my own theory of success -- and i &apos;m somebody who is very interested in success . i really want to be successful .

i &apos;m going to tell you about how i learned something about life .
and the chinese then , in one of their periods of media openness , decided that they were going to let it go , that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly .
you can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time , let alone generate real , pal@@ p@@ able innovations that improve people &apos;s lives .

you have to have low cost , but you also have to have a function .
why , then , do rocks look and feel solid and hard and im@@ penetr@@ able ?
i can start any number of places , because this process is also -- i think -- very different from some of the morning sessions , which you had such a kind of very clear , such a line@@ al idea , like the last one , say , with howard , that i think the creative process in architecture , the design process , is extremely circuit@@ ous . it &apos;s labyrin@@ thin@@ e .
almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn &apos;t enter it until after neil armstrong and buzz al@@ drin went to the moon .
contemporary political map shows that we have over 200 countries in the world today .
when they &apos;re laid out , i can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile , you know , just immediately , right ?

i mean we &apos;re essentially using technology to just jam evolution into fast-forward .
i &apos;d want one to realize that defense usually wins champion@@ ships , and would work hard on defense .
so that we go from a &quot; all rights reser@@ ved &quot; world to a &quot; some rights reser@@ ved &quot; world so that people can know the free@@ doms they have attached to the content , building and creating on the basis of this creative copy@@ ri@@ ghted work .
he &apos;s another young designer from france who &apos;s working -- and at this point he &apos;s working , also , with pharmaceutical companies -- on new ways to engage patients , especially children , in taking their medicines with con@@ stan@@ cy and with certainty .

we &apos;re adding the jeffer@@ sonian agenda , and i come from charlot@@ tes@@ ville , where i &apos;ve had the privilege of living in a house designed by thomas jefferson .
she was married against her will at age 13 .
and i &apos;m interested in searching for life in the universe .
so that means that we can have some form of self-@@ replication .
thank you . good evening and welcome to &quot; spot the ted pres@@ enter who used to be a broadway ac@@ compan@@ ist . &quot;
but you see that happening on the high line , and i think that &apos;s the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other .
and how come you ain &apos;t got a job anyway ?
it was a big mis@@ communication .
so you &apos;re kind of trying to say , &quot; people of iran , this is your destiny , lets go there . &quot;
bes@@ s thro@@ ck@@ mor@@ ton ?
that &apos;s okay , because there &apos;s a team of research scientists in canada who have now created a sto@@ ol sample , a fake sto@@ ol sample which is called re@@ po@@ op@@ ulate .
this is all behavioral autonomy here that &apos;s being conducted by the robot on its own .
i would bet there aren &apos;t 10 percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carri@@ ers there are in the world .
we drive up the street here , we find a family here which ear@@ ns about two to three dollars a day .
this is in paris , along the seine .

if the family &apos;s poor , they find it difficult to visit , and gradually the relationship breaks down .
so imagine -- let &apos;s suppose we &apos;re doing it .
it &apos;s specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight , and it fills the middle portion of the fly , so when a fly hits your wind@@ shield , it &apos;s basically the power muscle that you &apos;re looking at .

remember , this is 50 million dollar@@ s-@@ worth of value .
but what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way , he didn &apos;t want to sign that contract , he wanted to go to college -- which is what my mother , who actually does love me , said that i should do too , and i did -- well , he didn &apos;t do very well . he struggled mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly .
so this is the other group of subjects who often disagree .
and they gave them a series of painful electric sho@@ cks .
this is called resilience .
i want you to know that me , my brother and sister actually like eating bak@@ ed k@@ ale chips .
my interest is in artists who understand and re@@ write history , who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art , but who have created new places for us to see and understand .

and yet , what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there &apos;s a very , very strong dis@@ proportion@@ ality at work , that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportion@@ ate to the degree of expense ent@@ a@@ iled , or the degree of force that &apos;s applied .
buy it .
so in my village now , kids there , they normally listen to bbc , or any radio , and they are waiting to know , the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school .
you can get more bang for your bu@@ ck , let &apos;s say .
and we did that experiment , that you see here .
so the surgeon can see inside the patient , through their lens , where the tumor is , where the blood vessels are .

first assumption : if a choice affects you , then you should be the one to make it .
so as you can guess , my mother tongue is french .

and for the economists out there , you may be interested to know i actually made a pretty predictable income , which was shocking to me given i had no regular customers , but pretty much 60 bucks on a tuesday , 90 bucks on a friday .
after we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the sali@@ ent issues were with girls and boys and playing -- because , after all , that &apos;s really what this is about -- we moved to the second phase of our work , where we interviewed adult experts in acade@@ mia , some of the people who &apos;d produced the literature that we found relevant .
and anybody coming in new to technology is an adoles@@ cent online right now , and so it &apos;s very awkward , and it &apos;s very difficult for them to do those things .
the water@@ pro@@ o@@ fing is done perfectly , better than our city contra@@ ctors , because not a single drop should go waste in this .
with calculus , the whole idea of sub@@ division is more complex , because the whole and the parts are one continuous series .
we didn &apos;t really realize that until 19@@ 14 , when the last passenger pigeon , a female named martha , died at the cin@@ cin@@ nat@@ i zoo .

every man in this room , even you , steve , is george clo@@ oney .
i did what most of us do -- i tried it on some colleagues .
the energy consumption of the united kingdom , the total energy consumption , not just transport , but everything , i like to quantify it in light bulbs .

so as you zoom in , you know , you can see earth , you know , just in the middle here . so we zo@@ omed all the way on the art center .
now , david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab , but before he does that , he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place .
it was a nurturing , loving environment , where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defen@@ ses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood , because they were going through it too .

it doesn &apos;t make them good people , but it &apos;s at the heart of engineering , at the heart of a creative community , an innovative community , and the open source community , the basic e@@ thos of it is , take what other people do , make it better , give it back so we all rise further .
and if our universe got hit by another , that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect .
for example , a friend of mine .
then i am drowning , in despair at having to leave her , this , everything , all , unbe@@ arable , awful .
but what politicians need is a range of options .
and then you have yemen .
unfortunately , this tape isn &apos;t long enough -- it &apos;s only a 25-@@ foot tape .

indeed , to implement the slogan of health for all , we will need to involve all in that particular journey , and in the case of mental health , in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregi@@ vers .
in the end , if we test everyone by hand in exam@@ s , it &apos;s kind of hard to get the curricul@@ a changed during the seme@@ sters .
i really like turning the pages of the old testam@@ ent . &quot;
so recently , we asked ourselves if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects , maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of tell stories about architecture .
-- you go up to the file menu and you choose &quot; new . &quot; now , what happens when you choose &quot; new ? &quot; do you get a new blank document ?

i &apos;m happy , actually , today , to present her .
they take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money &apos;s flowing to meet those demands .

then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three nobel laure@@ ates , meet in copenhagen in may 2004 .

the digital world can@@ nib@@ alizes time , and in doing so , i want to suggest that what it threat@@ ens is the comple@@ ten@@ ess of ourselves .

you transform it inside as a train car .
this is the only place you can go nowadays and not get &quot; fri@@ ended . &quot;
the one goal , the one dream i &apos;d had for as long as i could remember -- i hadn &apos;t even come close .
josh plot@@ nik : hi , my name is josh plot@@ nik , and i &apos;m with think elephants international , and we &apos;re here in the golden triangle of thailand with the golden triangle asian elephant foundation elephants .
when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to china , it has , you know , led to consider@@ able angst amongst the western populations .
so there &apos;s more . there &apos;s more .
you gotta make it your own . you gotta design it .
this is the guy that invented it , sir c@@ live sinclair , and he &apos;s showing his machine .
and then , i got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art , and i didn &apos;t have any pieces .
and so he looked very du@@ bi@@ ous , as@@ anga did .
and , you know , there &apos;s a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be , you know , situ@@ ated somewhere here -- right in there between delight and bli@@ ss .
it &apos;s not clear .
the term &quot; compassion &quot; -- typically reser@@ ved for the sa@@ in@@ tly or the sa@@ ppy -- has fallen out of touch with reality . at a special ted@@ prize @ un , journalist kri@@ sta ti@@ ppe@@ tt de@@ constru@@ cts the meaning of compassion through several moving stories , and pro@@ poses a new , more at@@ tain@@ able definition for the word .
so we have an agreement .
what &apos;s even more surprising is that self-@@ grades , where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incenti@@ vi@@ ze them properly so they can &apos;t give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades .
we invited 10 of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days .
but the sound we are gre@@ eted with , as the room is bath@@ ed in the simulated glow of lat@@ e-@@ afternoon light , rec@@ alls to mind a dirty men &apos;s room in the re@@ ar of a greek coffee shop .
when talking about those reasons , let &apos;s break down certain pre@@ concep@@ tions .
you can wait as long as you want .
so , &quot; my beautiful mother &apos;s family fl@@ ed russia as well .
now , mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time , but it &apos;s clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because , if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed , it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthes@@ ized with unknown functions .
now , they differ a great deal in terms of the predic@@ tability of time frames .
and we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that &apos;s unlikely , because of the pres@@ um@@ ption of inno@@ cence .
you can make some sort of a bio@@ fuel cell .
and it turned out that lots of these ho@@ stages actually died as a result of inhal@@ ing the gas .
i wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself , or copied it from someone else ?
so it &apos;s acting , in a sense , like a living system trying to preserve itself .
i &apos;ve invested in pakistan for over seven years now , and those of you who &apos;ve also worked there can at@@ test that pakistan@@ is are an incredibly hard working population , and there is a fier@@ ce upward mobility in their very nature .
now , 20@@ th-century psychologists and soci@@ ologists were thinking about strangers , but they weren &apos;t thinking so dynamically about human relations , and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influ@@ encing practices .
and then you look at the out@@ puts and you start measuring what comes out .
and back here in the united states , we saw economic despair , deprivation .
i don &apos;t know if you know albert bandura .
but , to my credit , i was so embarrassed about doing that that i never submitted this sketch .
so it &apos;s over the baby , illumin@@ ating a single patient .
it was once called ne@@ p@@ tune .
maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here .
so , what have i learned from this experiment that i would like to tell the world ?
you can also stop a rain@@ drop and open the feeling inside .
and the important point about this is that it &apos;s the earliest study in combin@@ ator@@ ics in mathematics .
the second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house .
so , there are many , many more children who need to be treated , and in order to expand the scope of the project , we are planning on launching the prakash center for children , which will have a dedicated pedi@@ at@@ ric hospital , a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting-edge research facility .
so , i started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting .
thank god you can all read !
un@@ en@@ cum@@ ber@@ ed by clinical responsibilities , un@@ willing to take no for an answer from those bureau@@ cra@@ cies that tend to cr@@ ush patients , and with an un@@ parall@@ eled ability for information re@@ tri@@ eval hon@@ ed through years of using google .
so what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it &apos;s going to be safe ?
and the computer models , no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use , are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions .
she says , &quot; i bought a present for my mom .
these are st@@ ills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn &apos;t and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years .
really powerful dynamic .
in 19@@ 30 this country went through a great depression , which led to all the ideas of the state and social security , and all the other things that happened in roosevelt &apos;s time .
no@@ a : why ? they were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely .
that &apos;s the power of taking one piece of data , another piece of data , putting it together , and showing the result .
and when the coloni@@ al period ended , what you had in place of that was , generally , secular dictat@@ ors , which say they &apos;re a country , but did not bring democracy to the country , and established their own dictator@@ ship .
but at any rate , we finally did have a device that would re@@ produ@@ ce@@ ably put a frog out of sight and get him back alive .
so , you can put circuit components on the sta@@ ples , like a light bulb and a light switch .
marco tempest : augmented reality , tech@@ no-@@ magic
i spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down .
stayed in service till it was too ru@@ sty to fly , taken out of service .
i want to conclude with a music video .
no wonder that by age five i was a ra@@ ging feminist -- although the term had not reached chile yet , so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me .
these technologies want us to stay in the game that society has de@@ vised for us .
bf : from my foot , the kick up in the seven .
it &apos;s everybody . &quot; the chinese .
so the notion of collaboration -- i think this rein@@ forces how important that is .
and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps .
and then i go and have some tea .
if you leave it on the pa@@ vement and if all the adults go away , then they will show off with each other about what they can do .
that &apos;s why this year china will become the world &apos;s largest engli@@ sh@@ -@@ speaking country .
think about the enormous moral authority of the dalai lama -- and it comes from his moral humility .
and you say you work in education , you can see the blood run from their face . they &apos;re like , &quot; oh my god , &quot; you know , &quot; why me ? my one night out all week . &quot;
but we need to know how to do it .
and that &apos;s a big task : persu@@ ading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so .
but the home needs to start passing on cooking again , for sure .
now , i &apos;ve got a story for you .
so let me show you something .
if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s certainly affecting their eggs and larvae , i would certainly think .
so it wasn &apos;t just me , there was a whole generation of us .
i basically decided that it was i , not the camera or the network , or anything that lay outside myself , that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tun@@ ing .
and yet , that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later , on the other side of the universe , some bit of chemical sc@@ um could accurately describe , and model , and predict , and explain , above all -- there &apos;s your reference -- what was happening there , in reality .
and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of cere@@ als .
now we also study more complex expressions . this is consol@@ ation .
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
it &apos;s linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospit@@ ality and just being there , just showing up .
the richest people in africa are head@@ s-@@ of-@@ state and ministers , and quite often the chief band@@ it is the head-@@ of-@@ state himself .
if people want to use it in their labs for working on research , just reconstruct it yourself , because , you know , it might break in fe@@ dex .
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
imagine if you could hear a story you didn &apos;t expect of somebody who wa@@ kes up every day and works very , very hard to make their life better .
i &apos;m telling you where i &apos;m insecure .
another thing that helped me as a little kid is , boy , in the &apos; 50s , you were taught man@@ ners .
and this leads to the second bias , which economists have called loss a@@ version .
now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize .
it was sort of a spoo@@ ky story .
in the old days of the silent movies -- har@@ old l@@ loy@@ d here , hanging famously from the clock hands -- a lot of these guys did their own stunts . they were quite remarkable .
we use these every day .
when you &apos;re watching your stocks plum@@ met into the red , when you &apos;re watching your house price go down , you &apos;re not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms .
and then i put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very , very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what i got .
i now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable mo@@ dem .
rio , if anyone cares about the environment , need not have been a bust , okay ?
the news continues to give us a picture where men out@@ number women in nearly all occupa@@ tional categories except two : students and home@@ makers .
who &apos;s the teacher ?
and you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump , bump , bump , bump , bump .
the important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context .
i &apos;m going to read quickly -- and probably i &apos;m going to edit some , because i don &apos;t have that much time left -- a few of the columns .
they were all in a circle .
it &apos;s a space that &apos;s more intuitive in which i present fragments of the story , beginnings of other stories , photogra@@ phic evidence .
and they brought in jack nick@@ l@@ aus and arn@@ old pal@@ mer .
and when i was making icons , i was , like , the icon master , and i was , like , yeah , i &apos;m really good at this , you know .
so we have to study all kinds of different materials , the shape that we want to do .
i was so fascinated by that oxygen commercial .
and that happened for all museums .
so this is a big issue for us .
i experienced this fir@@ sth@@ and as a high school student in uganda .
&quot; there &apos;s a flip side to everything , &quot; the saying goes , and in 2 minutes , derek si@@ vers shows this is true in a few ways you might not expect .
i flew to cleveland , and my family rus@@ hed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye .
this terrified people .
were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs ?
but unfortunately molas , even though they don &apos;t school , they still get caught in nets as by-@@ catch .
there were endless stories of mexic@@ ans as people who were fle@@ ec@@ ing the healthcare system , sne@@ a@@ king across the border , being arrested at the border , that sort of thing .
and the first is pretty obvious .
my final story is about a young , beautiful man named jo@@ sep@@ hat by@@ ar@@ u@@ h@@ anga , who was another acumen fund fellow , who ha@@ ils from uganda , a farming community .
like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn bar@@ bec@@ ue .
oh , i &apos;ve been here before . and when you &apos;ve been here before , this happened next . it allows you to predict the future .
birds witnessed the emergence of flo@@ wer@@ ing plants .
but in fact , i would argue that we &apos;ve just done an experiment here and now , which shows us that the global need for correc@@ tive eye@@ wear is around half of any population .
and by the age of 11 , i was no longer going to sunday mass , and going on bir@@ d@@ watching walks with my father .
but that doesn &apos;t really make you flu@@ ent .
because stigma gives un@@ official license to treat people living with hiv or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens .
this is the mathematics of metaphor .
so we worked very hard to make them as life@@ like as possible .
if i separate them again , i have some light .
well , i hope to change that in less than three minutes .
there &apos;s a writer i &apos;ve been deeply influenced by , par@@ ker pal@@ mer , and he writes that many of us are often whi@@ plas@@ hed &quot; between arrogant over@@ esti@@ mation of ourselves and a servi@@ le under@@ esti@@ mation of ourselves . &quot;
thank you .
of course , old media companies and adver@@ tis@@ ers need to know this .
and you make a plan .
this is a rule device . and on the back are some other devices , measuring tools and scales , to be able to make some calculations . okay ?
so this is great for pick@@ led vegetables , which is what we &apos;re can@@ ning here .
if i place that between , now all the dough is touching , but if i stick that light back in , i have light .
so we got as close to it as possible , and i &apos;m going to share this -- chris , if you want to roll this film -- and then i &apos;m going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels .
you know , we fought hard to get at least a small pakistani cont@@ ing@@ ent to come .
why have you taken our apple ?
and so a new awareness will have to arise , of how we deal with these , how we mobili@@ ze ourselves , in a new way , and come together as a community to manage syste@@ mic risk .
so all in all , that &apos;s going very well .
let me show you what it looks like in real life .
did you notice something ?
the tasmanian devil is pre@@ domin@@ antly a sc@@ a@@ ven@@ ger , and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to ch@@ om@@ p on the bones of ro@@ tting dead animals .
because at pas@@ so@@ ver , when we have to eat un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed bread , the rabbis say , what is the difference between dough that is made into bread , and dough that is made into un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed bread , or &quot; ma@@ tz@@ ah &quot; ?
part of the question that i have answered is , is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli : with human achievement , with history , with the things that drive us and make us human -- the passionate discovery , the bones of dinosaurs long gone , the maps of space that we &apos;ve experienced , and ultimately the hall@@ ways that stimulate our mind and our imagination .
we spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables , which is why we need all the diet aids .
perhaps that big ?
how will they grow this curiosity ?
and so i find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it , we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment .
come on up . tell everybody your name .
he couldn &apos;t match it up to any bones on the planet , and he said , aha ! it &apos;s extinct .
what &apos;s next : antarctica .
you see , businesses are not run as institutions , by the i@@ dio@@ syn@@ cras@@ ies of individuals .
an old lady , crying , was carried out of her house and up the road by her son .
a player in a game called &quot; project ent@@ ro@@ pi@@ a &quot; actually bought his own island for 2@@ 6,@@ 500 dollars .
i &apos;m hoping we can , for example , use that even to get wolfram alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly , and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with .
so he says , &quot; all right . &quot;
and in this way , you can take the gu@@ ess@@ work out of policy@@ -@@ making by knowing what works , what doesn &apos;t work and why .
that is not a super@@ la@@ tively efficient use of global resources , especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world .
and i &apos;m going to ask you to practice that , ok ?
my mother said , &quot; someone has to . &quot;
so kaluza said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space .
compare the chalk writing with the lex@@ ig@@ ram on the keyboard .
truck after truck after truck filled with stack after stack after stack of data .
&quot; you &apos;re just being too pi@@ cky . &quot;
if we can show some of the video , you can see it climbing up the wall .
they &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
those tam@@ per-@@ proof caps , that came from this .
and they started to quickly imit@@ ate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard .
and i &apos;ve always felt guilty about that .
now this , we make lots and lots of pumps .
if you have an industry that puts a smile on people &apos;s face , that &apos;s nollywood .
a study by the economic commission for africa showed a clear trend up@@ wards in governance in 28 african countries .
so if you look at that data -- it &apos;s right up on the national highway transportation safety administration &apos;s website -- you can just look at the raw data , and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that &apos;s in favor of car seats for children aged two and up .
widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as re@@ posit@@ ories of knowledge .
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ?
we have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics , tactics , weapons , dollars and cas@@ u@@ alties .
these relationship skills are so easy .
do we have free rei@@ g@@ n to design animals ?
capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
